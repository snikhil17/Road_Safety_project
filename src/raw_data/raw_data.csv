In its early days, the internet was described as an information superhighway. The metaphor has fallen out of use, but it captures an important truth. Highways have rules – speed limits; no drunk driving – because a free-for-all would be deadly.

The damage caused by reckless or malicious use of an information network is not as visible to passing traffic as a road accident, but there is no doubting the problem. A US Senate committee this week heard the testimony of Frances Haugen, a former employee of Facebook now turned whistleblower, on what she sees as the company’s negligent practices. Users of Facebook’s family of products number around 2.8 billion, so it matters to the whole world if they are hazardous.

Ms Haugen has leaked internal research to support her claim that the company is aware of detrimental effects caused by its services – exacerbating mental health problems in young teenagers, for example – but chooses profit over safety. She believes Facebook products “harm children, stoke division and weaken democracy”.

That effect is spread across a suite of applications. Instagram and WhatsApp are also part of the empire controlled by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive. The breadth of his realm was illustrated earlier this week when a technical fault shut down large parts of it. For most users that was a minor inconvenience, but there are places where Facebook is synonymous with the internet. Such power cannot be trusted to a negligent organisation. In Myanmar, Facebook has been a primary conduit for material inciting hatred against the Rohingya minority. The company does not dispute that it was used to instigate violence. But it focuses its moderating efforts on content in the US, since that is where it fears regulation.

The era of utopian romance around tech businesses, when it was claimed that they were connecting people for the betterment of humanity, is long past. The giants of the sector are now viewed as oligopolists, paying too little tax, hoarding personal data and neglecting the social cost of their business model.

Chemical plants are not free to discharge toxic waste into water supplies. Tobacco advertising is restricted. When, in the past, an industry’s product has been shown to cause pollution or ill health, government has stepped in. That process is catching up with Facebook. The task is much harder because the raw material it uses is information and designing regulation for that ends up in a debate over censorship. The boundary between tolerable unpleasantness and aggression against civil society is not easy to discern, as the UK government has discovered. Its online safety bill, as drafted, would hand Ofcom an awkward statutory duty to police the way digital platforms protect “democratically important” content without political bias; restricting harmful material without curtailing free expression.

But British regulation of Facebook is downstream of action taken in the US, where there is a federal move to break the company up to bolster competition. In theory, a challenger in the market could satisfy demand for a social network that takes its social responsibilities seriously. That is some way off, but Facebook’s dominance will not last forever. Its power was amassed in an era when the toxicity of its products was hidden from view. Thankfully, that era is drawing to a close.","['facebook', 'antisocial', 'products', 'information', 'haugen', 'material', 'era', 'facebooks', 'network', 'view', 'guardian', 'social', 'power']","Show caption Frances Haugen, a former employee of Facebook, testifies before a US Senate committee.

3,Mogul of Mystery,"Bride Lane Library/Popperfoto/Getty Images Robert Maxwell at a press conference announcing his acquisition of Mirror Group Newspapers, London, July 1984

Over the past two years—since the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein in July 2019 on charges of trafficking minors and then his suicide in prison; Prince Andrew’s calamitous television interview the following November, in which he tried to dissociate himself from Epstein’s crimes but instead brought his public career to an end; and the dramatic arrest in July 2020 of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s associate and former girlfriend, and her incarceration in a federal prison in Brooklyn—an image has recurred before my mind’s eye. Around ninety years ago a little boy called Jan Hoch, wearing a yarmulke and curled sidelocks, belonged to an Orthodox Jewish community—impoverished, Yiddish-speaking, devout—in the small town of Solotvino in Subcarpathian Ruthenia. His mother wanted him to be a rabbi, and he was destined for the yeshiva in Pressburg (now Bratislava) until war engulfed Europe. Although he escaped, and after many adventures entirely reinvented himself, a horrible fate awaited his family.

That little boy was Ghislaine Maxwell’s father. The story of Robert Maxwell—as Jan Hoch of Solotvino became after he had been variously “Private Leslie Jones,” “Lance-Corporal Leslie Smith,” “Sergeant Ivan du Maurier,” and “Captain Stone”—is so ghastly and so ludicrous and altogether so improbable that it might seem stranger than fiction. There might be echoes from Victorian novels—Mr. Merdle, the “man of the age” before he goes bust in Little Dorrit, or the still more mysterious financier Melmotte in The Way We Live Now—but neither Dickens nor Trollope could quite have invented Maxwell. He was by turns a desperate refugee, a brave soldier, a seemingly successful entrepreneur, a member of Parliament, a newspaper owner, and, as it transpired after his death, an outrageous swindler.

John Preston opens his entertaining and gruesome Fall with a scene earlier in the year of Maxwell’s death. In March 1991 he arrived in New York aboard his yacht, Lady Ghislaine, named after the daughter he had once neglected and bullied but who had become his loyal helpmate and accompanied him on this trip. He was there to pull off what he presented as his greatest coup yet by buying the New York Daily News. Eight months later the yacht was cruising off the Canary Islands with Maxwell aboard until November 5, when he disappeared. Soon afterward, his floating body was found, leaving a final riddle: Accident, suicide, or murder?

This man of mystery was formed by a bleak early life. He was born in 1923, one of the nine children of Mehel and Chanca Hoch, who lived in a two-room shack with a dirt floor. He loved, and was loved by, his mother, but was often beaten by his cruel father, the six-foot-five “Mehel the Tall,” who scratched such living as he could by buying animal skins from butchers and selling them to leather dealers; from him the son inherited his size and maybe his temperament. Much about Maxwell could be understood as a reaction to his childhood, his gluttony and love of luxury set against the poverty and hunger he had once known, his longing for power against powerlessness, maybe even his cruelty to others against the cruelty he had suffered.

Another heritage was his polyglotism. Solotvino lies in a region that during the past hundred and more years has changed hands repeatedly. Between the wars it was at the eastern extremity of Czechoslovakia, having previously been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; it then belonged briefly to Hungary, then the Soviet Union, and now is in Ukraine. Its Jews often acquired perforce several languages, and as an adult Maxwell could speak English (very distinctively), French, German, Russian, and Czech. Any religious heritage, on the other hand, he soon shed. Maxwell might be thought almost what the Irish call a spoiled priest, dropping out of the yeshiva and never again entering a synagogue for most of his life.

In March 1939 Czechoslovakia fell apart. Hitler arrived in Prague to declare the Czech rump a Reich dependency, while Slovakia became a puppet state under Monsignor Jozef Tiso, one of the more repellent prelates of that dark age for the Roman Catholic Church, who was later executed as a war criminal. Then in September Germany invaded Poland. Barely sixteen, Hoch managed to flee Solotvino. Many years later he gave one version of his adventures to a hagiographer, claiming that he had walked to Budapest, been imprisoned, and then fought off his warder and escaped, but he was such a fabulist that nothing he said can be accepted with any certainty. At any rate, he seems to have made his roundabout way to France and the exiled Czech army.

There’s no ambiguity about what happened to his family. Before the war had ended, Maxwell’s mother and father, grandfather, and three of his younger siblings were transported to Auschwitz and murdered. For many years Maxwell tried to obliterate this horror, never mentioning his childhood, origins, religion, parents, or their horrible deaths.

In late July 1940, Preston writes, “in French army uniform, carrying a rifle in his hand and unable to speak a word of English, the yet-to-be Robert Maxwell” disembarked in Liverpool. He had just turned seventeen and still wasn’t of military age, but he contrived to join the menial Pioneer Corps, digging ditches alongside more eminent refugees, German-Jewish doctors and musicians. A brief encounter with a woman shopkeeper helped him learn English, although he said that he had already learned it by listening to broadcasts of Winston Churchill’s speeches before he could understand them and absorbing their distinctive tones, which he fondly believed he could emulate.

By 1944 he had joined the British infantry, after changing his name regularly. The Normandy campaign found him as Sergeant du Maurier, from a popular brand of cigarette, leading a sniper section of the North Staffordshire Regiment with enough distinction to win a commission, and by March 1945 Captain Robert Maxwell, as he had finally become, won the Military Cross ( MC ), pinned on his chest by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery himself. He went beyond the call of duty in his own way. Maxwell much later described one incident when he shouted in German to enemy soldiers in a farmhouse, “Come out with your hands up. You are completely surrounded.” When they did, “I shot them all with my sub-machine-gun. I thought my boys would be pleased, but all they said was, ‘That’s not fair, sir, those lads had surrendered.’”

In Paris a few months after its liberation Maxwell met Elisabeth Meynard, known as Betty, at a servicemen’s club, swept her off her feet, and married her despite the apprehensions of her prosperous French Protestant family. “Long-suffering” is wholly inadequate to describe a woman who stuck with her monstrous husband until the end despite endless infidelities and scandals. They had four sons and five daughters. Ghislaine, the youngest, was born in 1961, three days before the eldest boy was so gravely injured in a road accident that he spent the remaining six years of his life in a coma. The children were treated horribly by their father, who belittled and humiliated them at every turn. At first Ghislaine was the worst victim, to the point that she was anorexic as a child, but Maxwell relented and she became his favorite, expensively educated at boarding school and Oxford, until Betty could call Ghislaine “spoiled, the only one of my children I can truly say that about.”

If the story of young Hoch’s escape from Solotvino was obscure, Captain Maxwell’s career after the war was also murky. He ended up in Berlin serving in British intelligence, which he may have done for some time after he left the army, while possibly working for other countries’ intelligence services as well. “Later on in life, he could never pass a spotlight without stepping into it,” Preston writes, but at this time, “like Harry Lime in…The Third Man, Maxwell seemed to belong in the shadows, slipping quietly from occupied zone to occupied zone.”

In Berlin he also found the basis of his fortune. He helped run a newspaper owned by Springer-Verlag, which before the war had been the world’s largest publisher of scientific books and journals, and struck a deal with Ferdinand Springer, the head of the firm. By then Maxwell had learned of his parents’ death, but as part of his willful erasure of the past he was quite ready to do business with a man who had prospered under the Third Reich. Springer needed someone who could sell his products internationally, and Maxwell was that someone. By 1948 he had secured world distribution rights to all of Springer-Verlag’s publications. Preston writes that “150 tons of books and another 150 tons of journals were loaded on to a goods train and taken to Bielefeld in western Germany. From there, a convoy of trucks brought them to London,” although the figures seem astonishing.

Soon afterward Maxwell bought into a small trading company, but he required the marketing weight of a larger established publisher, and acquired Butterworth, which specialized in medical and legal textbooks. After he created Butterworth–Springer as a subsidiary, he also needed capital, and Major John Whitlock, the head of Butterworth, introduced him to Sir Charles Hambro, scion of a banking dynasty, who “took an immediate shine to Maxwell.” His links to British intelligence may have helped, since Whitlock and Hambro had both served in that twilight world.

In later years not only was Maxwell’s reputation terrible but his personality was repulsive, the embodiment of what his native Yiddish calls grobkeit, boorish and vulgar. But before the passage of time coarsened him he must have been more personable, and for many years a remarkable number of people in the English commercial and financial establishment were taken in by him. With Hambro’s help Maxwell created a British distributor, whose turnover more than doubled between 1950 and 1951, when he changed the name of Butterworth–Springer to Pergamon. Scientific books and journals were a real money-spinner, since universities and libraries needed them, and learned authors didn’t expect to be paid.

Some of the refugees who enlivened London publishing after the war—André Deutsch, Paul Hamlyn, George Weidenfeld—might have been colorful and not always popular with their long-established rivals, but Maxwell was something else again. As he ensconced himself at Headington Hill Hall outside Oxford, Preston says, “darkness—and the whiff of chicanery—was never far away.” Nigel Lawson would one day be chancellor of the exchequer in Margaret Thatcher’s government, but in the early 1950s he was an Oxford undergraduate and found a lowly vacation job working at Maxwell’s warehouse, where he was startled to find that school textbooks rejected as defective in England were being sold in Africa.

For his next move Maxwell went into politics, capriciously choosing Labour, and in 1964 Captain Maxwell added “ MP ” to the “ MC ” after his name when he was elected to Parliament as member for Buckingham. The Labour Party didn’t know quite what to make of this “very strange fellow,” as the diarist, former Oxford don, and future cabinet minister Richard Crossman described him: “a Czech Jew with a perfect knowledge of Russian, who has an infamous reputation in the publishing world.” The House of Commons didn’t know what to make of him either, as he became a byword for bombastic garrulity. Completely ignoring parliamentary convention about the length and frequency of speeches, he held forth more than two hundred times in ten months. He was made chairman of the Commons catering committee partly to shut him up, and he soon wrote off the debts of loss-making bars and dining rooms through what was effectively a fire sale, disposing of the cellar of fine wines for far beneath their value, plenty of them ending up at Headington Hill Hall.

Few at Westminster were sorry to see Maxwell lose his seat in 1970, when he returned to his lurid business career. Before floating Pergamon on the stock exchange in 1964 he had created tax-free trusts in Liechtenstein to make his dealings as opaque as possible, but when in 1969 an American firm bid to take over the company, it withdrew its offer after discovering that Maxwell had inflated sales and profit figures. By 1971 inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry had scrutinized Maxwell’s affairs and published a report describing him as “not…a person who can be relied on to exercise proper stewardship of a publicly quoted company.”

It might seem extraordinary that he could have continued in business at all after that. But Maxwell wasn’t called “the bouncing Czech” for nothing, and soon he bounced back, with his new ambition to become a press magnate. He had already tried and failed to buy the Sun (formerly the Daily Herald, and the voice of the Labour Party) before attempting to buy News of the World, that monument to English salacious prurience. “It would not be a good thing for Mr. Maxwell,” said the editor, Stafford Somerfield, “formerly Jan Ludwig Hoch, to gain control of…a newspaper which I know is as British as roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.” Those distasteful words had an unintended effect, quickening the interest of a young entrepreneur who was as British as roast wallaby. Rupert Murdoch pounced, and his acquisition of News of the World in 1968 began his adventure as a London media mogul. It also began a comical rivalry that lasted more than two decades, in which Maxwell was always outplayed by Murdoch. He thought he was fighting another boxer, the late Harold Evans observed, when “in fact, he’d entered the ring with a ju-jitsu artist who also happened to be carrying a stiletto.” Whatever else one thinks of him, Murdoch was a formidable operator, whereas Maxwell was always a sham.

And yet bouncing on he went, fending off criminal charges all the while, and by 1981 he had acquired control of the British Printing Corporation, until recently the largest printing group in the country, which he renamed the Maxwell Communications Corporation ( MCC ). In 1984 he achieved what seemed a real triumph by buying the Daily Mirror. In its midcentury heyday it had been a great popular newspaper that had won the circulation war as the first true voice of the English working class, and it was still the second-best-selling paper in the country after Murdoch’s Sun. I was in San Francisco for the Democratic Convention when news of the sale reached us, and a group of English scribblers repaired to a bar near Union Square, where Keith Waterhouse, a veteran Mirror columnist, danced a little jig mocking “Cap’n Bob,” before he escaped to the Daily Mail.

What happened next was no laughing matter. Or rather, Maxwell became a bad joke, as he turned the paper into a vehicle for his own glorification, with his face continually appearing in its pages and his fatuous opinions trumpeted. The staff shuddered at his profane and abusive tirades, shouted over the vast coffee cup on his desk that bore the motto “ VERY IMPORTANT PERSON .” He nevertheless found people ready to do his bidding. Roy Greenslade would later write in haughty tones about media matters for The Guardian while clandestinely helping the terrorist Irish Republican Army, as he has recently admitted, but he had earlier served as Maxwell’s editor of the Mirror, and at his behest rigged the competitions in the paper so that the prizes offered would never be won. Before Alastair Campbell became Tony Blair’s spin doctor and helped orchestrate the war of lies that preceded the invasion of Iraq, he also worked for Maxwell. Joe Haines, formerly press officer to Harold Wilson at Downing Street, wrote a ludicrously heroic “official biography” of Maxwell, and Peter Jay, who had been the British ambassador in Washington, became his “chief of staff.”

In 1986 the Thatcher government drastically deregulated the financial markets of the City of London, which was meant to lead to a new golden age of vigorous competition, as was similar deregulation of Wall Street. What ensued was a weird era of reckless casino capitalism, with dazzling innovations like credit default swaps and subprime mortgages, all leading to the crash of 2008. But there was a foretaste of that by way of Maxwell. By the late 1980s his vaunted business empire was in deep trouble, requiring one surreptitious expedient after another to disguise its grave condition. In the hope of cleansing his name Maxwell offered numerous charitable donations—for AIDS research, for starving Ethiopians—but somehow the promised funds rarely arrived.

And yet still the banks—forty-four of them at one point!—lined up to lend him money. They accepted MCC stock as collateral, requiring more stock to be transferred if the share price fell below a certain point, not bothering to wonder whether the price had any real meaning. In fact, while Maxwell was servicing his debts by mortgaging stock (“pig on pork,” as the term of art has it), he was inflating that price by buying MCC stock with money he first borrowed, then stole. As he edged ever closer to the brink he used the oppressive English libel laws to silence critics, notably Private Eye, but when in July 1990 the Financial Times took a hard look and said that shares in his company were essentially worthless, he didn’t dare sue.

Nor was his next (and last) victory all he claimed. By the time Maxwell proudly bought it, the Daily News was near collapse, with circulation plummeting, production controlled by the unions, and distribution controlled by the mob. There was one moment of comic relief when a print union negotiator said that Maxwell seemed “like an English nobleman,” a unique estimation. An even better one came when he insinuated himself into a Washington lunch party where he sat next to President George H.W. Bush and loudly held forth on world affairs. As the bemused Bush left he could be seen mouthing, “Who was that guy?” Funniest of all was when Maxwell ordered Jim Hoge, the publisher of the Daily News, to ring Murdoch in the middle of the Australian night and say that he had bought the paper, at which Murdoch burst into laughter and thanked Maxwell for being so helpful.

Shortly thereafter came his mysterious death. An autopsy showed that he had been alive for hours in the water and may have desperately clung to the boat before his heart gave out, which could suggest an accident, but he had good reason to end it all. And enough was already known about him to make the tributes he received quite grotesque. The recently deposed Thatcher said that Maxwell had shown the world “that one person can move and influence events by using his own God-given talents and abilities,” the Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock called him “one of the few people I have known who deserved to be called irreplaceable,” while Mikhail Gorbachev was “deeply grieved.”

And then the shattering truth emerged. Maxwell’s whole operation was fraudulent: it collapsed with debts of several billion pounds, with the banks that had accepted stock as collateral losing £655 million. Worst of all, the desperate Maxwell had looted £429 million from his companies’ pension funds, including the Mirror’s.

Nothing in this story is so strange as Maxwell’s identity, or what he made of it. He transformed himself into his version of an English—or Scottish—officer and gentleman. About five years before his death, he was dining in Edinburgh with Ian Watson, one of his editors, when the floodlights silhouetting Edinburgh Castle against the night sky came on. “Look, Watty,” Maxwell said, “there’s a sight to warm the hearts of true Scotsmen like you and me!” Watson thought he was joking: “It took a few moments for me to realize Maxwell was being completely serious.”

When he was elected to Parliament in 1964 Maxwell was called by the Jewish Chronicle, which likes to take note of Jewish achievements, including the number of MP s. “I’m not Jewish,” said the sometime yeshiva boy, and put down the telephone. Twenty years later, in the witness box at one of his court cases, he tearfully recalled his mother’s death in Auschwitz, which cynics thought a convenient turn at a time when he wanted sympathy. But his belated acceptance might have been prompted by his personal disintegration, or maybe intimations of mortality.

Did he try to come to terms with the past he had so long concealed? He had begun giving—or at least promising—money to Israeli charities, and when he died no one was more fulsome than Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and future president of Israel, who called Maxwell “not a man but an empire in his power, thought and deeds.” Before the awful truth became known, his body was taken to Jerusalem and given something like a state funeral on the Mount of Olives. A kind of homecoming for the little boy from Solotvino, or a last macabre joke?","['thought', 'mogul', 'stock', 'solotvino', 'maxwell', 'british', 'war', 'world', 'maxwells', 'english', 'later', 'mystery']","Eight months later the yacht was cruising off the Canary Islands with Maxwell aboard until November 5, when he disappeared.

6,Court seizes Karnataka government’s bus for not paying compensation to accident victim family,"In a first, a lower court in Karnataka has seized a bus belonging to the state-run corporation after it failed to pay Rs 2.82 crore compensation to a road accident victim’s family.

The court had ordered North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) to pay the amount to the family of a software developer who died in a road accident in 2013. The victim, 39-year-old Sanjeev M Patil, was knocked down by a state transport bus while he was crossing the road at Jall tollgate in Bengaluru-Pune Highway around 6 am.

The family went to the court to seek compensation on the grounds that Sanjeev was just 39 years at the time of the accident and was earning Rs 2.10 lakh per month at IBM. The family claimed compensation to the tune of Rs 3.55 crore along with interest.

NWKRTC claimed that the accident occurred on account of Sanjeev’s negligence. However, the court held that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving by the bus driver. The court also observed that an independent witness blamed the driver and the NWKSRTC did not have any evidence to prove that Patil’s negligence led to his death.

The court held that the claimants were entitled to a compensation of Rs 2.15 crore along with an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum to be paid by the NWKSRTC.

The second additional senior civil judge at Davanagere said, “court which went through the documents and salary slips came to a conclusion that Sanjeev Patil monthly income was Rs 1,57,178 and deducting the personal expenses of Sanjeev Patil, it comes around Rs 1,17,884.

Speaking to indianexpress.com, Jagadeesh VS, divisional controller of NWKRTC’s Haveri division, who is the first respondent in the case, said: ”We have paid Rs 1.52 crore compensation and had taken the case to the high court. However, there was no stay order which made the court officials seize the bus. We are asking the court to give us more time to pay the money as the corporation has also run into huge losses due to Covid-19 situation.

He said that a bus costs about Rs 29 lakh and the bus that was seized is two years old and did not operate much due to the pandemic situation.","['bus', 'paying', 'court', 'compensation', 'rs', 'account', 'road', 'seizes', 'crore', 'karnataka', 'victim', 'governments', 'pay', 'family', 'sanjeev', 'accident']","In a first, a lower court in Karnataka has seized a bus belonging to the state-run corporation after it failed to pay Rs 2.82 crore compensation to a road accident victim’s family.
The court had ordered North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) to pay the amount to the family of a software developer who died in a road accident in 2013.
The family went to the court to seek compensation on the grounds that Sanjeev was just 39 years at the time of the accident and was earning Rs 2.10 lakh per month at IBM.
The family claimed compensation to the tune of Rs 3.55 crore along with interest.
However, the court held that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving by the bus driver."

11,Bengaluru: Web-based GIS system to make commute safer for school-goers,"In a bid to ensure safe commute to school-goers in Bengaluru, a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) tool named Safer Access to Schools (SATS) has been launched in the city.

According to its inventors World Resources Institute (WRI) India, an organisation dealing with environmental and sustainability research, and Underwriters Laboratories, the tool is expected to help policymakers make informed decisions.

According to a recent study, 86 per cent of school children travel less than five kilometres to reach their schools in the city while 58 per cent of them walk to schools.

Sree Kumar Kumaraswamy, head of integrated transport, WRI India, noted that there is a crucial gap in data-based understanding and interventions linked to safety around schools.

“Data is crucial to develop an evidence-based understanding of road safety concerns along each of the schools and can bring together various government stakeholders, NGOs, researchers, and private individuals towards a collaborative action,” he said.

Further, WRI shared insights into road accident fatalities in the city noting that nearly 31 per cent of pedestrian crash fatalities and six per cent of children’s fatalities occurred within 250 metres of the school zone, citing National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data from 2019.

Meanwhile, participating in a discussion titled ‘Enabling Safer Streets for Bengaluru’ at WRI India’s ‘Connect Karo 2021’ event, joint commissioner (traffic) B R Ravikanthe Gowda conceded that space constraints for pedestrians to walk on the road is observed in many areas of the city.

“Some schools in Bengaluru have gates opening directly to the roads. With no specific parking areas available, students get on and off vehicles on the roads, and school managements choose not to bother about them once they are left outside the premises,” Gowda noted.

The top traffic cop stressed the need to prioritise pedestrian safety while designing roads, adding that the Bengaluru traffic police force was also taking measures to impart traffic education to students in schools.

“More pedestrian fatalities in road accidents are getting reported in outer parts of the city than those in CBD (central business district) areas. We need to prioritise the safety of pedestrians while designing roads,” he said.

Meanwhile, Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) commissioner V Manjula said that work is progressing on an ‘Active Mobility Act’, expected to give pedestrians and cyclists the right to complete and connected networks.

“It puts the onus on local bodies to provide good infrastructure and has provisions for ‘mobility wardens’ from the public, who can give suggestions for infrastructural improvements. We need coordination and design policies in place, which will be followed by all stakeholders,” she explained.","['wri', 'roads', 'webbased', 'school', 'schools', 'commute', 'road', 'fatalities', 'gis', 'cent', 'bengaluru', 'schoolgoers', 'system', 'traffic', 'safer', 'safety']","In a bid to ensure safe commute to school-goers in Bengaluru, a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) tool named Safer Access to Schools (SATS) has been launched in the city.

12,"Karnataka: Mother kills adult daughter to hide affair, father helps in dumping body","Karnataka police have arrested three persons for the murder of a 28-year-old woman in Chikkaballapura district. Among those arrested were the murder victim’s parents and uncle. While the mother and the uncle allegedly killed the woman, the victim’s father conspired to pass off the murder as suicide, thinking it to be a case of honour killing.

Chikkaballapura district superintendent of police Mithun Kumar GK said, “Parveena Banu alias Shilpa, a resident of Musalmanarahalli, was murdered earlier this month. Her parents, Gulzar Banu (45) and Fayaz (50), and uncle, Pyaarejan (60), have been arrested in connection to her death. Fayaz is speech impaired and Parveena was his eldest daughter.”

Chikkaballapura district police said the incident took place on September 4.

Cops said that Parveena Banu was murdered after she came to know about her mother’s extra-marital relationship with her uncle. Cops said that Parveena Banu was murdered after she came to know about her mother’s extra-marital relationship with her uncle.

Police sources said Parveena was married to a man from the same community around 10 years ago, but she separated from him a day after their marriage. She then married her boyfriend, Shivappa, who was a resident of Manivala village, and changed her name to Shilpa. But Shivappa was an alcoholic and died owing to poor health. Parveena later started living with another man but he, too, died in a road accident.

Cops said that Parveena was murdered after she came to know about her mother’s extra-marital relationship with her uncle. To hide their affair, Pyaarejan strangled her with a jacket.

After committing the murder, Pyaarejan told Fayaz that they killed Parveena for she had married a man from another religion. Parveena’s father, Fayaz, who was not aware of his wife’s affair with Pyaarejan, helped in transporting the body and dumping it in a dry well in Vatadahosahalli.

On September 5, Gauribidanur rural police retrieved Parveena’s body from the well and an autopsy was conducted on it. Police initially assumed that Parveena might have died by suicide but the post-mortem report suggested that she was strangled to death.

Police, finally, cracked the case after checking the call detail record of Parveena’s mobile phone. Cops found that Parveena had last spoken to her mother and uncle. Upon questioning, both the culprits confessed to their crime. Parveena’s father was arrested for his role in hiding the murder.

Sources said that Fayaz did not know that Parveena was killed to hide the truth of his wife’s affair and now regrets to have helped in covering up the murder.","['helps', 'kills', 'mother', 'uncle', 'murdered', 'affair', 'dumping', 'murder', 'parveenas', 'fayaz', 'parveena', 'hide', 'father', 'daughter', 'arrested', 'banu', 'body', 'karnataka', 'know', 'pyaarejan']","Chikkaballapura district superintendent of police Mithun Kumar GK said, “Parveena Banu alias Shilpa, a resident of Musalmanarahalli, was murdered earlier this month.

13,"In 20 days, three cops severely injured in road accidents while on duty","THREE UT police personnel, who were critically wounded while performing their duties, have been admitted to the PGIMER and undergoing multiple surgeries. While two of them, Deepak and Harsh Kumar, were knocked down by speedy vehicles while performing traffic duties, a woman constable, Papita, on cash protection duty, was almost crushed between two vehicles carrying cash that belonged to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Both her legs were severely injured. While Papita with met the tragic road accident on September 6, constable Deepak was injured near the Police Beat Box in Sector 36 on September 23. Head Constable Harsh Kumar, a member of the UT Police Cycle Squad, was injured on the cycle track near Sector 45 on September 24.

Constable Papita has undergone at least seven surgeries, since, and more are underway. She says, “My left leg was completely motionless. But now there is sensation in my left leg. Though both my legs were severely wounded, the left leg received maximum injuries. I am grateful to my senior officers and the police department, for bearing the expenses of my treatment.” After an hour long rescue operation, uncertainty still loomed over her fate, as she was pulled out from the remains of the front body of the truck. She continues to be admitted at PGI.

Constable Deepak, who was posted near Sector 36 Beat Box was knocked down by a speedy car. He received critical head injuries. He, too, was rushed to PGI and underwent a head surgery. “Doctors have successfully removed a big blood clot from the head but Deepak is still under observation. His behavior is unusual. Sometimes he starts shouting about his naka duties. Doctors told us that he will be absolutely fine within a couple of days,” said a close relative of Deepak. He has been admitted in the Neuro-surgical ward.

“Harsh is said to be stable but doctors told us that it will at least take a year for Harsh to fully recover from his jaw and bone injuries. Immediately after the incident, Harsh was rushed to GMCH-32. Today, we took him to PGI for his jaw surgery. Harsh’s treatment has cost around Rs 50,000 so far. The police department is cooperating with us. They have given around Rs 15,000 for the treatment. The senior officers are cooperating”, said Deepak Kumar, Harsh’s elder brother.

DSP Jaswinder Singh of Children Traffic Park (CTP), Sector 23, said, “These incidents, especially on the traffic nakas, are an alarming call.

14,Madras HC quashes order increasing speed limit to 120 kmph on highways,"The Madras High Court has set aside a notification of the central government, fixing 120 kmph as the speed limit for vehicles plying on highways.

A division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran (since retired) and Justice T V Thamilselvi, which quashed the notification dated April 6, 2018, recently, also directed the Centre and the State to issue fresh notifications with decreased speed limit.

Originally, while passing interim orders on an appeal on March 3 this year, the bench, the other member being Justice Abdul Quddhose, increased the compensation amount from Rs 18.43 lakh to Rs 1.50 crore to the appellant — a dentist, who had suffered 90 per cent disability due to a road accident occurred in April 2013 in Kancheepuram in Tamil Nadu.

The bench had also raised a set of 12 queries, the first of which was for a direction to the central government to reconsider its 2018 notification, increasing the speed limit to 120 kmph. The matter was posted in August for filing compliance report.

In its report, the Centre justified its action in increasing the speed limit. It said that keeping in view the better engine technology and improved road infrastructure, an expert committee was constituted to review the speed limits of motor vehicles and as per its recommendations, the maximum speeds for vehicles on different roads had been revised by the Ministry in the April 6 2018 notification.

However, the present bench observed that though there was a better engine technology and improved road infrastructure, there was no improvement in compliance of the road safety rules by the motorists.

From the report released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the number of deaths taking place on roads would prove that more accidents were occurring due to over speeding.

Also Read | Tamil is the Language of Gods, says Madras High Court

When over speeding was a major cause for road accidents, it is not known as to how the improvement in road infrastructure and engine technology would reduce accidents. In fact, better engine technology would always be a reason for uncontrolled speed and thereby, cause more accidents, the bench said.

“Having known that over speeding is the main cause for road accidents, taking away the precious lives of people and causing damage to properties, the decision taken by the central government, as reflected in the notification dated April 6, 2018 is liable to be quashed.” the bench said and accordingly quashed it.

It also said that the State and the central governments should reduce the speed limit as per August 5, 2014 notification and prescribed a set of speed limits for different types of vehicles.

“Though the matter arises under the Motor Vehicles Act, taking note of a dentist sustaining spinal cord injury and that she is unable to do any work on her own and that she has to depend on others throughout her life, this court invoking Article 226 of the Constitution, suo motu, in public interest, passed this judgment,” the bench added.","['order', '120', 'madras', 'kmph', 'speed', 'technology', 'road', 'accidents', 'increasing', 'quashes', 'hc', 'engine', 'limit', 'notification', 'vehicles', 'central', 'bench', 'highways']","The Madras High Court has set aside a notification of the central government, fixing 120 kmph as the speed limit for vehicles plying on highways.

15,Making streets safe for all: Delhi govt launches six-month online campaign on road safety,"In an attempt to reduce the number of deaths on the streets, the Transport Department has launched a social media campaign, #SadakSurakshitDilliSurakshit. It is aimed at generating online conversations and awareness on four risk factors – speeding, drunk driving, wearing helmets and seatbelts.

A collaboration between the Delhi government and the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, the campaign was launched by Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot at the Road Safety Summit on Friday morning. Over the next six months, @delhiroadsafety will raise awareness on Facebook and Twitter.

“The roads belong to pedestrians as much as they belong to people in vehicles. Through our campaign, we hope to increase awareness about evidence-based best practices in road safety and ensure Delhi roads are safer for all road users. Through the Delhi government’s partnership with the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, we aim to reduce these deaths on the streets of Delhi and hope to build an ecosystem where we do not tolerate any loss of life on our streets,” said Gahlot.

A number of important conversations revolving around road safety were taken up at the summit, with officials and experts sharing the stage.

They said that last year, 1,196 persons were killed while 3,662 persons were left injured in road crashes in the city. They spoke about how deaths and injuries are preventable by means of safer street designs, changes in behaviour supported by strategic communication and enforcement of traffic laws and use of high-quality data for strengthening road safety policies.

A Road Safety Action Plan was presented by Deepak Kumar IAS, Special Commissioner, Road Safety, Transport Department. In his presentation, he spoke about how there has been a 42 per cent decline in accidents over the last decade. Their vision for 2030 is to prevent 50 per cent road traffic deaths and injuries. This can be done by structural intervention, engaging stakeholders, technological intervention, road safety partnerships and regulatory approach.

Structural intervention would include identifying blackspots, creating safe school zones, pedestrian-friendly streetscaping and lane disciplining. At present, 20 blackspots have been identified in the city. He elaborated that implementing an Integrated Road Accident Database (an application to record and manage crash data) would help. Further, he said that Delhi has been treating driving as a life skill and as a first of its kind in the world, automated driving tracks are being set up in educational institutes.

A panel discussion on how Delhi can prevent 50 per cent fatal crashes was held. Experts also discussed the need to create more safe school zones as a number of government school students in the city walk to school and they perceive speeding as a threat. A pilot project has been taken up around a government school in Vasant Kunj and more such projects will be taken up soon.

Another panel discussion regarding the role of citizen groups in supporting the government’s efforts to prevent crashes was discussed. Officials also stressed on the redevelopment of 540 km stretch of roads, which will make a huge part of the city more pedestrian-friendly.","['city', 'roads', 'launches', 'school', 'streets', 'govt', 'transport', 'road', 'taken', 'safe', 'sixmonth', 'online', 'making', 'deaths', 'delhi', 'safety']","A collaboration between the Delhi government and the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, the campaign was launched by Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot at the Road Safety Summit on Friday morning.

16,Maximum road deaths in Bengaluru are reported on Sundays,"Despite weekend lockdowns owing to the Covid-19 pandemic being in force for the greater part of last year, Bengaluru city reported a higher number of deaths and accidents on Sundays.

Like the rest of the country, the city was under lockdown from the last week of March to the first week of June in 2020. Thereafter, the state government enforced weekend lockdowns for a few more months.

In 2020, Bengaluru city reported 657 deaths due to road accidents, of which 109 fatal accidents were reported on Sundays alone. While the number of deaths due to road accidents has come down compared to 2019 (832 deaths) and 2018 (870 deaths), officials attribute the development to the Covid-19 lockdown and associated curbs. Even in previous years, Sundays reported more road accidents compared to other days of the week. While Saturdays recorded fewer fatalities.

Speaking to the IndianExpress.com, joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda said, “Many people who come to Bengaluru during weekends are in a hurry to return to their places on Sundays, leading to a higher number of road accidents. Notably, most mishaps reported on Sundays result from speeding.”

Asked whether lockdown reduced the number of road accidents, Gowda said: “It might have been a factor but the enforcement of laws has played a vital role in reducing the numbers.”

Nightmare for pedestrians

In 2020, 164 pedestrians died in the city due to road accidents, but what continues to be a major concern is that many of the victims lost their lives despite adhering to traffic rules. At least 82 persons died even when they were standing in areas designated for pedestrians. Nearly 332 two-wheeler riders also died in road mishaps.

The data revealed that 189 persons in the 21-30 age group died in road accidents in 2020. Whereas 101 persons aged between 41-50 and 73 persons between 51-60 years lost their lives. Fifty-five persons in the age group of 11-20 also perished in road accidents.

Of the 655 persons accused in road accidents, 438 were in the 21-40 age group. These included 273 self-accidents. Only 17 persons above 61 years were accused of road accidents.

The data also revealed that 51 per cent of accident victims in 2020 died even before they could be taken to a hospital. While 162 persons died on the spot, another 177 persons died on their way to a hospital. Sadly, 308 persons succumbed to their injuries in hospital. The traffic police in its report said that passers-by often failed to respond adequately during the golden hour (the first hour after the accident) and in several instances were seen taking videos and photos of the accident sites and the victims.

The police have said that the boy, identified as Sabir Khan, a resident of Sare Kalan village in Tijara tehsil of Alwar district, died in a vehicle collision after being caught in the middle of a chase between alleged cow smugglers and people chasing them. The teenager’s family members, however, accused the police of trying to suppress the matter.

According to the FIR registered in the matter, the incident took place at around 5:45 am on Sunday morning near Nehar Khedi Road in Alwar district.

Sabir’s family members have stated in the FIR that the teen, along with his friends, would go running every morning and around 4-5 days ago, they had an argument with one Anil over the latter’s reckless driving.

“On that day, Anil had threatened my nephew and his companions that ‘after today if I see you running on this road, then I will run you down with this car and you won’t be do anything to me because I have relationships with Gauraksha Dal and Bajrangbal (sic)’,” says the FIR lodged by Sabir’s uncle after the incident.

The FIR says that after running over Sabir with their car on Sunday morning, the accused also reminded his friends of his prior threat.

Sabir’s friend Mohammed Alim, 20, who was present at the time of the incident, said: “Each day, several of our friends would go for running on that road. Some time back, we had an argument with Anil, a resident of a nearby village, when we asked him not to overspeed since we run on that road. Anil had threatened us at that time. He works with the Bajrang Dal. On Sunday morning, after running over Sabir, he slowed down the car and told me, I have run over your brother, now you know me,” said 20-year-old Mohammed Alim, who was present at the time of the incident.

He claimed that after Anil hit Sabir with his car, another car which was also being driven by his associates drove over the boy.

Imran Khan, a cousin brother of Sabir, said: “Sabir was studying in class 11 and wanted to join the Army. Each day, along with his friends he would go on a run and exercise early in the morning. Earlier as well, people from nearby village Bhogipur who are associated with the gau raksha dal and Bajrang Dal had threatened the kids. On Sunday, they deliberately ran Sabir over with their vehicles despite the fact that he was standing at the side of the road. These people have created a terror here in the name of cow protection.”

On the basis of the complaint submitted by the family of Sabir, the police have registered an FIR at the Chupanki police station under sections 302 (murder), 143 (unlawful assembly) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), naming seven accused — Anil, Mintu, Himansu, Pushkar, Soun, Rahul and Abu, all residents of Haryana.

“Preliminary investigation suggests that a vehicle in which cows were being transported was passing the area and it hit Sabir. The people in that vehicle were cow smugglers. There was another vehicle driven by locals which was following the cow smugglers to catch them. This vehicle too hit Sabir. An FIR has also been registered at the Tauru Sadar police station in Nuh district of Haryana against the cow smugglers and 15 cows were found in their vehicle. Sabir was hit by two vehicles — one being driven by the cow smugglers, other belonging to those chasing the smugglers,” said Hari Ram Kumawat, deputy superintendent of police, Bhiwadi police circle.

He added that so far the police have arrested three people Sonu, Narendra and Harkesh in the matter on the basis of police investigation.

Family members of Sabir, including his cousin Imran and brother-in-law Shahrukh, accused the police of trying to suppress the matter.

“The police want to completely change the direction of the case and suppress the issue. There is no role of any vehicle transporting cows. The accused threatened the kids before and then killed Sabir,” said Imran.

Alim, who was on the spot at the time of the incident, said that Sabir was hit by cars being driven by the accused and denied that he was hit by a vehicle transporting cows.

The police denied the allegations of police inaction.

“The family members have said in the FIR that the accused had threatened them before. But in preliminary investigation we haven’t found anything to corroborate this. It appears to be a case of road accident but still, we are carrying out the investigation and more will be clear after the probe. An FIR has been registered in Haryana related to cow smuggling and we have registered an FIR regarding the death of the kid. It is wrong to say that police are trying to suppress the matter,” said Bhiwadi SP Ram Moorty Joshi.

He added that in preliminary investigation association of the accused with any organization hasn’t been found and further probe is being conducted.","['smugglers', 'anil', 'vigilantes', 'accused', 'sabir', 'vehicle', 'road', 'morning', 'teenager', 'alwar', 'fir', 'cow', 'involvement', 'alleges', 'run', 'hit', 'family']","A 16-year-old boy in Rajasthan’s Alwar district was allegedly run over by self-styled cow vigilantes on Sunday morning, his family members have alleged.

18,Bewilderment by Richard Powers review – stars in their eyes,"We might think of Richard Powers as one of contemporary fiction’s big-game hunters, were that not a woefully inappropriate tag for a novelist whose recent work is animated by a truly non-Hemingwayan philosophical orientation: deep ecology. The Overstory, a novel of the highest ambition and ideational scope for which Powers was awarded a Pulitzer prize, explored territory usually ceded to writers of science fiction: the frontier relationship between the human and the nonhuman (specifically, our planet’s trees, given dramatic life as intelligent and interconnected species).

Bewilderment, Powers’s more immediate new novel, is narrated in the first-person and is half the length of The Overstory’s wilderness stretch. Theo Byrne is a grieving widower and astrobiologist whose work involves building simulated worlds to help determine whether exoplanets beyond our solar system can support life. He does his floundering best to raise his son, Robin: “my sad, singular, newly turning nine-year-old, in trouble with this world”. Theo’s wife, Alyssa, died in a road accident when Robin was seven, and Bewilderment is among other things a triangular family romance.

Bewilderment channels both the cosmic sublime and that of the vast American outdoors

As father and son process their tragedy, the human species accelerates towards ecocide and self-ruination. The novel’s title is perfect: himself a cosmic orphan awed by astral immensities, Theo feels out of his depth as a parent (“I could no more raise a child than I could speak Swahili”), while recognising that his possibly autistic, bipolar or attention-deficit son is a rare and luminous being. A pocket moral absolute, Robin is incapable of knowing that countless species face extinction without devoting himself to resisting this death-drift. The tenderness and delicacy with which the father-son relationship is depicted repeatedly brought to my mind Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, though it is a pre-apocalyptic planet on which Theo and Robin struggle to find fortitude and hope. (Interestingly, Powers, who is in his 60s, is not a father.)

Among the novel’s many virtues is the mood it radiates of sheer cosmic awe. Robin worries himself into fits of agitation by asking the question posed in the Fermi paradox: seeing as the universe is incomprehensibly vast, why have we found no sure signs of intelligent life in its abyss? When Olaf Stapledon’s classic sci-fi novel of aeonic scope Star Maker is mentioned (“the Bible of my youth”), it is not unexpected. Richard Powers is coming to seem a gift to those of us who admire Stapledon’s genre but regret its indifference to human complexities. Impressively precise in its scientific conjectures, Bewilderment is no less rich or wise in its emotionality. Moreover, science fiction is not just a looming generic presence, but part of the novel’s narrative mechanism. In periodic, myth-like passages, Theo takes his son on inner voyages to fantastical alien worlds based on the deep space atmospheric models he creates at work.

Bewilderment channels both the cosmic sublime and that of the vast American outdoors, resting confidently in a lineage with Thoreau and Whitman, Dillard and Kerouac. It’s also a ghostly and affecting love story. Given the choice between putting his difficult son on meds to appease his school authorities and submitting him to experimental neuroscientific research involving emotional states transferred between human subjects, a disquieted Theo watches Alyssa’s resurrected personality merge with Robin’s. Spectral echoes of Solaris haunt these uncanny passages.

We are into the terrain here of myth, metaphysics and religion. Sorrowing awe is Bewilderment’s primary tone, and its many remarkable scenes are controlled with high novelistic intelligence. Robin is as compelling a fictional creation as I’ve encountered in some time – fierce, lovable and otherworldly. In dreaming him up, Powers was clearly working out a bold fictive question: what must it be like to father a Greta Thunberg? The penny dropped for me when “the world’s most famous 14-year-old” makes a cameo: Inga Alder, identical to Thunberg in all but name. A mesmerised Robin falls in love with her over TV and YouTube: “She’s like me, Dad.”

19,The Making of Incarnation by Tom McCarthy review – all work and no play,"Show caption Tom McCarthy: ‘boundary-pushing’. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian Fiction The Making of Incarnation by Tom McCarthy review – all work and no play Time-and-motion studies meets motion-capture acrobatics in a hi-tech saga that’s big on detail but devoid of insight Jonathan Myerson Sun 12 Sep 2021 13.00 BST Share on Facebook

After consecutive Booker shortlistings, Tom McCarthy’s reputation as a boundary-pushing novelist seems set. But, perhaps more than anything he’s written, this latest work tempts the question: what exactly does a novel have to offer the reader in order to be classified as such?

Structurally, it’s hard to quibble: The Making of Incarnation is multi-stranded in a tradition that goes back to Dickens. Monica Dean, a young lawyer, is at the LSE, researching the early history of time-and-motion studies – an anonymous client is interested in whether movements can be copyrighted. Mark Phocan is also at work: Pantarey is a motion-capture specialist company on the outskirts of Oxford, today enticing a couple to perform enthusiastic sex while plastered in digital markers. And Ben Briar has a new job as scientific adviser on the sci-fi blockbuster Incarnation.

Dean, like everyone else in the book, is only shown doing what she’s employed to do

From there, these strands plough forwards. Dean is sent to Indiana to the archives of Lillian Gilbreth – in the 1930s, she was one of the early pioneers of workplace engineering. In this retelling, she has catalogued her observations in 3D models, illustrating workers’ movements in miniaturised arcs, each reconstructed in a thousand numbered shoeboxes.

Meanwhile, Phocan is sent to Soho to start work on Incarnation – its invented far-galactic world may be a mumbo-jumbo of Athenian-cum-medieval vocabulary and swordplay, but his CGI must ensure that the light from the nearby nebula falls with Hawkingesque precision throughout the spaceship, most especially on the gravity-free copulation scene. There’s barely a page without something like “the accumulated data being fed into the gait lab’s server, amalgamated with cached readings from his previous two sessions and fed forward to the online cataloguing systems of CMAC and ESMAC...” At first, these incomprehensible paragraphs do generate a cutting-edge atmosphere, but they very soon merge into so much IT wallpaper.

Yet far from needing all this factuality, fiction thrives on unknowns – the actual one that drives the plot, and the psychological one, which will give it resonance beyond a mere story. So the upfront mystery kicks in when Dean unearths Gilbreth’s letter to a physicist in then-Soviet Lithuania: apparently, Box 808 “changes everything”, and may in fact encapsulate the “perfect movement”. Result! But Box 808 is missing from the shelves. And when she pushes, Dean’s library access is revoked; soon after, the client also terminates the contract.

McCarthy tells us nothing about the rest of Dean’s life, creates no narrative that might show us how this episode enlarges or diminishes her. The modern novel thrives on moments when an individual behaves out of character but Dean, like everyone else in the book, is only shown doing what she’s employed to do. So what, novelistically speaking, is in it for the reader?

Meanwhile, Phocan spends 23 pages watching a bobsleigh team make use of a digitised wind tunnel. Job done. He travels to a disused sardine factory in Norway to motion-capture an acrobatic team for Incarnation. Job done. And finally, he is sent to Riga to prise Box 808 from the aged Lithuanian physicist. Job not done, because the only tangible result is a less-profound-than-James-Bond coupling with the physicist’s granddaughter, followed by her grandfather’s suicide. Again, Phocan remains unchanged by these events.

But a novel must surely enable us to invest in the central characters’ aspirations or failings or loves and losses. In Remainder, McCarthy’s unforgettable breakthrough novel, the protagonist may be gripped by a Paul Austerish need to painstakingly restage a road accident but his obsession becomes the human enigma that resonates far beyond the mechanics. In this latest book, having lured us with work lives packed with IP, IT and CGI, he offers no enigma, no insight. We are left with what the characters are employed to do, nine to five, and little more. It’s minutely described and probably realistic, but is that a novel?

Using notes left by the founding father of “tartan noir” William McIlvanney (1936-2015), bestselling Scottish novelist Ian Rankin has completed a prequel to the author’s magnificent trilogy featuring police officer Jack Laidlaw. Set in Glasgow in 1972, The Dark Remains (Canongate, £20) is not so much an origin story – the bookish, thoughtful and often acerbic loner, blueprint for Inspector Rebus and many others, seems fully formed and entirely recognisable – as a homage. When lawyer Bobby Carter, right-hand man to gang boss Cam Colvin, is stabbed to death, the police are concerned that this may be the opening salvo in a turf war between the city’s criminal factions. Although a lowly DC, Laidlaw ignores the orders of his blundering superior and strikes out with his own investigation. Ever-changing loyalties and betrayals abound – not least Laidlaw’s selfish neglect of his wife and children – and although the denouement may be predictable, and Rankin’s prose might not quite match McIlvanney’s inimitable style, The Dark Remains is an immersive and satisfyingly pitch-black read.

Set in Sydney, the latest book from the bestselling Australian author Liane Moriarty, Apples Never Fall (Michael Joseph, £20), is an engrossing mashup of family drama and psychological suspense that offers a mystery – the disappearance of 69-year-old Joy Delaney on Valentine’s Day 2020 – then trawls back through the past half century to unravel it. The Delaneys are a tennis family: Stan and Joy met as champions and toured the circuit together before setting up an academy. Although their four children are good players and spent their formative years practising relentlessly, none had the precise combination of physical and psychological qualities that make a champion – unlike Stan’s star pupil, who seemed set to give the pair vicarious glory until he inexplicably jumped ship to another coach. Now retired, Stan and Joy find themselves rudderless, and when a young woman turns up on their doorstep, distressed, they allow her to move in – much to the dismay of their children, who soon begin to suspect that she is not, as she claims, a victim of domestic violence. This is a complex and satisfying tale of the sacrifices we make, the way we betray one another and the slippery nature of memory: perfect holiday reading.

The Rosebud Native American Reservation in South Dakota is the setting for a fascinating debut novel, Winter Counts (Simon & Schuster, £14.99) – the first in a projected series featuring vigilante-for-hire Virgil Wounded Horse – written by David Heska Wanbli Weiden, member of the Sicangu Lakota Nation. Struggling with issues of identity, Virgil acts on behalf of those failed by the unsatisfactory combination of toothless tribal police and a US criminal justice system that all too often declines to prosecute wrongdoers. But the professional becomes personal when his 14-year-old nephew Nathan almost dies from a heroin overdose. With the help of ex-girlfriend Marie Short Bear, Virgil is determined to prevent the influx of the drug into the community, but the cartels are powerful and such authority as he has is extremely limited. Winter Counts is both a solid take on a trope familiar to readers of crime and western genres – the lone man’s quest for justice – and an authentic and humane view of a largely unreported world, ravaged by years of systemic oppression.

For those old enough to remember, the fuzzy outlines of quite a few real people will be visible behind the fictional characters in Robert Peston’s first novel, The Whistleblower (Zaffre, £14.99), set during the run-up to the 1997 general election, when John Major’s Tory government was ousted by a Labour landslide. Central to the action here is Gil Peck who, like his creator, is a political and financial journalist who has OCD – although presumably that’s where the resemblance stops, as Peck is also unscrupulous, obsessive, addicted and careless of the feelings of others. When his estranged sister, a Treasury official, dies in an apparent road accident, he smells a rat, and the resulting investigation uncovers financial shenanigans and undue influence in high places. While it’s not hard to guess who dun what, this enjoyable, intelligent thriller will be catnip for news junkies.

Toshihiko Yahagi

The Wrong Goodbye (MacLehose, £18.99) is the first novel by Japanese bestseller Toshihiko Yahagi to be translated into English, by Alfred Birnbaum. It’s a self-styled homage to Raymond Chandler, set in and around the US naval base at the entrance to Tokyo Bay, featuring hard-drinking police officer Eiji Futamura. His chance meeting with American pilot Billy Lou Bonney kicks off a sequence of events – dead and missing women, black marketeers, former Vietcong moles, triads – that have their roots in the Vietnam war. A clear indication of exactly when the book is set – around 2000, according to my arithmetic – would have removed an unnecessary layer of confusion from this complex, atmospheric thriller.","['set', 'virgil', 'crime', 'roundup', 'joy', 'laidlaw', 'remains', 'rankin', 'recent', 'thrillers', 'winter', 'featuring', 'novel', 'best', 'review', 'ian']","Show caption Prequel time for Jack Laidlaw … Ian Rankin.

STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a civilian police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were traveling, news media said.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist’s partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Muhammad drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle. He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

Vilks’ life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Al-Qaida put a bounty on Vilks’ head. In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden. Last year, a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.","['artist', 'dogs', 'protection', 'media', 'road', 'reportedly', 'sweden', 'threatened', 'vilks', 'muhammad', 'sketch', 'prophet', 'dead', 'swedish', 'accident']","Swedish artist Lars Vilks at his home outside Hoganas in Sweden, Sunday May 16, 2010.

23,Lars Vilks: Swede who lived under police protection after drawing Prophet Muhammad dies in crash,"The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, known for his 2007 drawing of the Prophet Muhammad and the subsequent death threats that followed, died in a car crash on Sunday.

Vilks, who was largely unknown outside of Sweden before his Muhammad drawing, had been living under police protection since 2007.

The drawing of Muhammand with a dog’s body led to a number of plots against him, and Al-Qaida put a bounty on his head.

In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden.

In 2015 he escaped unscathed in Copenhagen from an attack during a debate on Islamism and freedom of expression following the Charlie Hebdo massacre

Last year, a woman from Pennsylvania in the US pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.

Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Police said Vilks, 75, died alongside two of his bodyguards in a road accident.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks insisted he was not a racist and didn’t have a political position, but wanted to probe the limits of what we can and cannot do.

""I think it's very important, if you want to talk about freedom of expression and Islam and Muslims, to have a real position, to have something provocative and transgressive enough to start a debate,” he said.

On the day of the attack on Charlie Hebdo, Lars Vilks confided his sadness to the regional newspaper Helsingborgs Dagblad. ""We cannot give up on freedom of expression. The attack in Paris is unfortunately significant of the times we live in.”

A month later, on 14 February, a young Danish man of Palestinian origin tried to barge into a debate on freedom of expression organised in Copenhagen in response to the Charlie Hebdo massacre.

Vilks, the headliner of the meeting with the French ambassador, escaped unharmed, but a 55-year-old Danish film director was killed.

The assailant then managed to kill a Jewish security guard outside the Copenhagen synagogue, before being shot dead in a stand-off with Danish police.","['attack', 'expression', 'swede', 'protection', 'lived', 'dies', 'muhammad', 'debate', 'vilks', 'charlie', 'lars', 'drawing', 'crash', 'prophet', 'freedom', 'danish', 'copenhagen', 'hebdo']","The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, known for his 2007 drawing of the Prophet Muhammad and the subsequent death threats that followed, died in a car crash on Sunday.

28 September, 2021 15 min to read

In this article, we'll train the car to do self-parking using a genetic algorithm.

We'll create the 1st generation of cars with random genomes that will behave something like this:

On the ≈40th generation the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot:

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

Yeah-yeah, the cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so be merciful and give the cars some space to grow :D

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The genetic algorithm for this project is implemented in TypeScript. The full genetic source code will be shown in this article, but you may also find the final code examples in the Evolution Simulator repository.

We're going to use a genetic algorithm for the particular task of evolving cars' genomes. However, this article only touches on the basics of the algorithm and is by no means a complete guide to the genetic algorithm topic.

Having that said, let's deep dive into more details...

The Plan

Step-by-step we're going to break down a high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 bits (finding the optimal car genome).

Here is what we're going to do:

💪🏻 Give the muscles (engine, steering wheel) to the car so that it could move towards the parking spot. 👀 Give the eyes (sensors) to the car so that it could see the obstacles around. 🧠 Give the brain to the car that will control the muscles (movements) based on what the car sees (obstacles via sensors). The brain will be simply a pure function movements = f(sensors) . 🧬 Evolve the brain to do the right moves based on the sensors input. This is where we will apply a genetic algorithm. Generation after generation our brain function movements = f(sensors) will learn how to move the car towards the parking spot.

Giving the muscles to the car

To be able to move, the car would need ""muscles"". Let's give the car two types of muscles:

Engine muscle - allows the car to move ↓ back, ↑ forth, or ◎ stand steel (neutral gear) Steering wheel muscle - allows the car to turn ← left, → right, or ◎ go straight while moving

With these two muscles the car can perform the following movements:

In our case, the muscles are receivers of the signals that come from the brain once every 100ms (milliseconds). Based on the value of the brain's signal the muscles act differently. We'll cover the ""brain"" part below, but for now, let's say that our brain may send only 3 possible signals to each muscle: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

type MuscleSignal = - 1 | 0 | 1 ;

For example, the brain may send the signal with the value of +1 to the engine muscle and it will start moving the car forward. The signal -1 to the engine moves the car backward. At the same time, if the brain will send the signal of -1 to the steering wheel muscle, it will turn the car to the left, etc.

Here is how the brain signal values map to the muscle actions in our case:

Muscle Signal = -1 Signal = 0 Signal = +1 Engine ↓ Backward ◎ Neutral ↑ Forward Steering wheel ← Left ◎ Straight → Right

You may use the Evolution Simulator and try to park the car manually to see how the car muscles work. Every time you press one of the WASD keyboard keys (or use a touch-screen joystick) you send these -1 , 0 , or +1 signals to the engine and steering wheel muscles.

Giving the eyes to the car

Before our car will learn how to do self-parking using its muscles, it needs to be able to ""see"" the surroundings. Let's give it the 8 eyes in a form of distance sensors:

Each sensor can detect the obstacle in a distance range of 0-4m (meters).

(meters). Each sensor reports the latest information about the obstacles it ""sees"" to the car's ""brain"" every 100ms .

. Whenever the sensor doesn't see any obstacles it reports the value of 0 . On the contrary, if the value of the sensor is small but not zero (i.e. 0.01m ) it would mean that the obstacle is close.

You may use the Evolution Simulator and see how the color of each sensor changes based on how close the obstacle is.

type Sensors = number [ ] ;

Giving the brain to the car

At this moment, our car can ""see"" and ""move"", but there is no ""coordinator"", that would transform the signals from the ""eyes"" to the proper movements of the ""muscles"". We need to give the car a ""brain"".

Brain input

As an input from the sensors, every 100ms the brain will be getting 8 float numbers, each one in range of [0...4] . For example, the input might look like this:

const sensors : Sensors = [ s0 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 , s7 ] ;

Brain output

Every 100ms the brain should produce two integers as an output:

One number as a signal for the engine: engineSignal One number as a signal for the steering wheel: wheelSignal

Each number should be of the type MuscleSignal and might take one of three values: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

Brain formulas/functions

Keeping in mind the brain's input and output mentioned above we may say that the brain is just a function:

const { engineSignal , wheelSignal } = brainToMuscleSignal ( brainFunction ( sensors ) ) ;

Where brainToMuscleSignal() is a function that converts raw brain signals (any float number) to muscle signals (to -1 , 0 , or +1 number) so that muscles could understand it. We'll implement this converter function below.

The main question now is what kind of a function the brainFunction() is.

To make the car smarter and its movements to be more sophisticated we could go with a Multilayer Perceptron. The name is a bit scary but this is a simple Neural Network with a basic architecture (think of it as a big formula with many parameters/coefficients).

I've covered Multilayer Perceptrons with a bit more details in my homemade-machine-learning, machine-learning-experiments, and nano-neuron projects. You may even challenge that simple network to recognize your written digits.

However, to avoid the introduction of a whole new concept of Neural Networks, we'll go with a much simpler approach and we'll use two Linear Polynomials with multiple variables (to be more precise, each polynomial will have exactly 8 variables, since we have 8 sensors) which will look something like this:

engineSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( e0 * s0 ) + ( e1 * s1 ) + ... + ( e7 * s7 ) + e8 ) wheelSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( w0 * s0 ) + ( w1 * s1 ) + ... + ( w7 * s7 ) + w8 )

Where:

[s0, s1, ..., s7] - the 8 variables, which are the 8 sensor values. These are dynamic.

- the variables, which are the sensor values. These are dynamic. [e0, e1, ..., e8] - the 9 coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static.

- the coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static. [w0, w1, ..., w8] - the 9 coefficients for the steering wheel polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static

The cost of using the simpler function for the brain will be that the car won't be able to learn some sophisticated moves and also won't be able to generalize well and adapt well to unknown surroundings. But for our particular parking lot and for the sake of demonstrating the work of a genetic algorithm it should still be enough.

We may implement the generic polynomial function in the following way:

type Coefficients = number [ ] ; const linearPolynomial = ( coefficients : Coefficients , variables : number [ ] ) : number => { if ( coefficients . length !== ( variables . length + 1 ) ) { throw new Error ( 'Incompatible number of polynomial coefficients and variables' ) ; } let result = 0 ; coefficients . forEach ( ( coefficient : number , coefficientIndex : number ) => { if ( coefficientIndex < variables . length ) { result += coefficient * variables [ coefficientIndex ] ; } else { result += coefficient } } ) ; return result ; } ;

The car's brain in this case will consist of two polynomials and will look like this:

const engineSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( engineCoefficients , sensors ) ) ; const wheelSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( wheelCoefficients , sensors ) ) ;

The output of a linearPolynomial() function is a float number. The brainToMuscleSignal() function need to convert the wide range of floats to three particular integers, and it will do it in two steps:

Convert the float of a wide range (i.e. 0.456 or 3673.45 or -280 ) to the float in a range of (0...1) (i.e. 0.05 or 0.86 ) Convert the float in a range of (0...1) to one of three integer values of -1 , 0 , or +1 . For example, the floats that are close to 0 will be converted to -1 , the floats that are close to 0.5 will be converted to 0 , and the floats that are close to 1 will be converted to 1 .

To do the first part of the conversion we need to introduce a Sigmoid Function which implements the following formula:

It converts the wide range of floats (the x axis) to float numbers with a limited range of (0...1) (the y axis). This is exactly what we need.

Here is how the conversion steps would look on the Sigmoid graph.

The implementation of two conversion steps mentioned above would look like this:

const sigmoid = ( x : number ) : number => { return 1 / ( 1 + Math . E ** - x ) ; } ; const sigmoidToMuscleSignal = ( sigmoidValue : number , margin : number = 0.4 ) : MuscleSignal => { if ( sigmoidValue < ( 0.5 - margin ) ) { return - 1 ; } if ( sigmoidValue > ( 0.5 + margin ) ) { return 1 ; } return 0 ; } ; const brainToMuscleSignal = ( rawBrainSignal : number ) : MuscleSignal => { const normalizedBrainSignal = sigmoid ( rawBrainSignal ) ; return sigmoidToMuscleSignal ( normalizedBrainSignal ) ; }

Car's genome (DNA)

☝🏻 The main conclusion from the ""Eyes"", ""Muscles"" and ""Brain"" sections above should be this: the coefficients [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] defines the behavior of the car. These 18 numbers together form the unique car's Genome (or car's DNA).

Car genome in a decimal form

Let's join the [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] brain coefficients together to form a car's genome in a decimal form:

const carGenomeBase10 = [ e0 , e1 , ... , e8 , w0 , w1 , ... , w8 ] ;

Car genome in a binary form

Let's move one step deeper (to the level of the genes) and convert the decimal numbers of the car's genome to the binary format (to the plain 1 s and 0 s).

I've described in the detail the process of converting the floating-point numbers to binary numbers in the Binary representation of the floating-point numbers article. You might want to check it out if the code in this section is not clear.

Here is a quick example of how the floating-point number may be converted to the 16 bits binary number (again, feel free to read this first if the example is confusing):

In our case, to reduce the genome length, we will convert each floating coefficient to the non-standard 10 bits binary number ( 1 sign bit, 4 exponent bits, 5 fraction bits).

We have 18 coefficients in total, every coefficient will be converted to 10 bits number. It means that the car's genome will be an array of 0 s and 1 s with a length of 18 * 10 = 180 bits .

For example, for the genome in a decimal format that was mentioned above, its binary representation would look like this:

type Gene = 0 | 1 ; type Genome = Gene [ ] ; const genome : Genome = [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , ] ;

Oh my! The binary genome looks so cryptic. But can you imagine, that these 180 zeroes and ones alone define how the car behaves in the parking lot! It's like you hacked someone's DNA and know what each gene means exactly. Amazing!

By the way, you may see the exact values of genomes and coefficients for the best performing car on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Here is the source code that performs the conversion from binary to decimal format for the floating-point numbers (the brain will need it to decode the genome and to produce the muscle signals based on the genome data):

type Bit = 0 | 1 ; type Bits = Bit [ ] ; type PrecisionConfig = { signBitsCount : number , exponentBitsCount : number , fractionBitsCount : number , totalBitsCount : number , } ; type PrecisionConfigs = { custom : PrecisionConfig , } ; const precisionConfigs : PrecisionConfigs = { custom : { signBitsCount : 1 , exponentBitsCount : 4 , fractionBitsCount : 5 , totalBitsCount : 10 , } , } ; function bitsToFloat ( bits : Bits , precisionConfig : PrecisionConfig ) : number { const { signBitsCount , exponentBitsCount } = precisionConfig ; const sign = ( - 1 ) ** bits [ 0 ] ; const exponentBias = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - 1 ) - 1 ; const exponentBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount , signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const exponentUnbiased = exponentBits . reduce ( ( exponentSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - bitIndex - 1 ) ; return exponentSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; const exponent = exponentUnbiased - exponentBias ; const fractionBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const fraction = fractionBits . reduce ( ( fractionSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** - ( bitIndex + 1 ) ; return fractionSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; return sign * ( 2 ** exponent ) * ( 1 + fraction ) ; } function bitsToFloat10 ( bits : Bits ) : number { return bitsToFloat ( bits , precisionConfigs . custom ) ; }

Brain function working with binary genome

Previously our brain function was working with the decimal form of engineCoefficients and wheelCoefficients polynomial coefficients directly. However, these coefficients are now encoded in the binary form of a genome. Let's add a decodeGenome() function that will extract coefficients from the genome and let's rewrite our brain functions:

const CAR_SENSORS_NUM = 8 ; const BIAS_UNITS = 1 ; const GENES_PER_NUMBER = precisionConfigs . custom . totalBitsCount ; const ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const GENOME_LENGTH = ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ; type DecodedGenome = { engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , } const genomeToNumbers = ( genome : Genome , genesPerNumber : number ) : number [ ] => { if ( genome . length % genesPerNumber !== 0 ) { throw new Error ( 'Wrong number of genes in the numbers genome' ) ; } const numbers : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let numberIndex = 0 ; numberIndex < genome . length ; numberIndex += genesPerNumber ) { const number : number = bitsToFloat10 ( genome . slice ( numberIndex , numberIndex + genesPerNumber ) ) ; numbers . push ( number ) ; } return numbers ; } ; const decodeGenome = ( genome : Genome ) : DecodedGenome => { const engineGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( 0 , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ) ; const wheelsGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ) ; const engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( engineGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; const wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( wheelsGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; return { engineFormulaCoefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients , } ; } ; export const getEngineMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { engineFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ; export const getWheelsMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { wheelsFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ;

Self-driving car problem statement

☝🏻 So, finally, we've got to the point when the high-level problem of making the car to be a self-parking car is broken down to the straightforward optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeros (finding the ""good enough"" car's genome). Sounds simple, doesn't it?

Naive approach

We could approach the problem of finding the ""good enough"" genome in a naive way and try out all possible combinations of genes:

[0, ..., 0, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 0, 1] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 1] , and then... ...

But, let's do some math. With 180 bits and with each bit being equal either to 0 or to 1 we would have 2^180 (or 1.53 * 10^54 ) possible combinations. Let's say we would need to give 15s to each car to see if it will park successfully or not. Let's also say that we may run a simulation for 10 cars at once. Then we would need 15 * (1.53 * 10^54) / 10 = 2.29 * 10^54 [seconds] which is 7.36 * 10^46 [years] . Pretty long waiting time. Just as a side thought, it is only 2.021 * 10^3 [years] that have passed after Christ was born.

Genetic approach

We need a faster algorithm to find the optimal value of the genome. This is where the genetic algorithm comes to the rescue. We might not find the best value of the genome, but there is a chance that we may find the optimal value of it. And, what is, more importantly, we don't need to wait that long. With the Evolution Simulator I was able to find a pretty good genome within 24 [hours] .

Genetic algorithm basics

A genetic algorithms (GA) inspired by the process of natural selection, and are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as crossover, mutation and selection.

The problem of finding the ""good enough"" combination of genes for the car looks like an optimization problem, so there is a good chance that GA will help us here.

We're not going to cover a genetic algorithm in all details, but on a high level here are the basic steps that we will need to do:

CREATE – the very first generation of cars can't come out of nothing, so we will generate a set of random car genomes (set of binary arrays with the length of 180 ) at the very beginning. For example, we may create ~1000 cars. With a bigger population the chances to find the optimal solution (and to find it faster) increase. SELECT - we will need to select the fittest individuums out of the current generation for further mating (see the next step). The fitness of each individuum will be defined based on the fitness function, which in our case, will show how close the car approached the target parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. MATE – simply saying we will allow the selected ""♂ father-cars"" to have ""sex"" with the selected ""♀ mother-cars"" so that their genomes could mix in a ~50/50 proportion and produce ""♂♀ children-cars"" genomes. The idea is that the children cars might get better (or worse) in self-parking, by taking the best (or the worst) bits from their parents. MUTATE - during the mating process some genes may randomly mutate ( 1 s and 0 s in child genome may flip). This may bring a wider variety of children genomes and, thus, a wider variety of children cars behavior. Imagine that the 1st bit was accidentally set to 0 for all ~1000 cars. The only way to try the car with the 1st bit being set to 1 is through the random mutations. At the same time, extensive mutations may ruin healthy genomes. Go to ""Step 2"" unless the number of generations has reached the limit (i.e. 100 generations have passed) or unless the top-performing individuums have reached the expected fitness function value (i.e. the best car has approached the parking spot closer than 1 meter ). Otherwise, quit.

Evolving the car's brain using a Genetic Algorithm

Before launching the genetic algorithm let's go and create the functions for the ""CREATE"", ""SELECT"", ""MATE"" and ""MUTATE"" steps of the algorithm.

Functions for the CREATE step

The createGeneration() function will create an array of random genomes (a.k.a. population or generation) and will accept two parameters:

generationSize - defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation.

- defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation. genomeLength - defines the genome length of each individuum in the cars population. In our case, the length of the genome will be 180 .

There is a 50/50 chance for each gene of a genome to be either 0 or 1 .

type Generation = Genome [ ] ; type GenerationParams = { generationSize : number , genomeLength : number , } ; function createGenome ( length : number ) : Genome { return new Array ( length ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? 0 : 1 ) ) ; } function createGeneration ( params : GenerationParams ) : Generation { const { generationSize , genomeLength } = params ; return new Array ( generationSize ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => createGenome ( genomeLength ) ) ; }

Functions for the MUTATE step

The mutate() function will mutate some genes randomly based on the mutationProbability value.

For example, if the mutationProbability = 0.1 then there is a 10% chance for each genome to be mutated. Let's say if we would have a genome of length 10 that looks like [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] , then after the mutation, there will be a chance that 1 gene will be mutated and we may get a genome that might look like [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] .

type Probability = number ; function mutate ( genome : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability ) : Genome { for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < genome . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { const gene : Gene = genome [ geneIndex ] ; const mutatedGene : Gene = gene === 0 ? 1 : 0 ; genome [ geneIndex ] = Math . random ( ) < mutationProbability ? mutatedGene : gene ; } return genome ; }

Functions for the MATE step

The mate() function will accept the father and the mother genomes and will produce two children. We will imitate the real-world scenario and also do the mutation during the mating.

Each bit of the child genome will be defined based on the values of the correspondent bit of the father's or mother's genomes. There is a 50/50% probability that the child will inherit the bit of the father or the mother. For example, let's say we have genomes of length 4 (for simplicity reasons):

Father's genome: [0, 0, 1, 1] Mother's genome: [0, 1, 0, 1] ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ Possible kid #1: [0, 1, 1, 1] Possible kid #2: [0, 0, 1, 1]

In the example above the mutation were not taken into account.

Here is the function implementation:

function mate ( father : Genome , mother : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability , ) : [ Genome , Genome ] { if ( father . length !== mother . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Cannot mate different species' ) ; } const firstChild : Genome = [ ] ; const secondChild : Genome = [ ] ; for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < father . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { firstChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; secondChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; } return [ mutate ( firstChild , mutationProbability ) , mutate ( secondChild , mutationProbability ) , ] ; }

Functions for the SELECT step

To select the fittest individuums for further mating we need a way to find out the fitness of each genome. To do this we will use a so-called fitness function.

The fitness function is always related to the particular task that we try to solve, and it is not generic. In our case, the fitness function will measure the distance between the car and the parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. We will implement the fitness function a bit later, but for now, let's introduce the interface for it:

type FitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) => number ;

Now, let's say we have fitness values for each individuum in the population. Let's also say that we sorted all individuums by their fitness values so that the first individuums are the strongest ones. How should we select the fathers and the mothers from this array? We need to do the selection in a way, that the higher the fitness value of the individuum, the higher the chances of this individuum being selected for mating. The weightedRandom() function will help us with this.

const weightedRandom = < T > ( items : T [ ] , weights : number [ ] ) : { item : T , index : number } => { if ( items . length !== weights . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Items and weights must be of the same size' ) ; } const cumulativeWeights : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < weights . length ; i += 1 ) { cumulativeWeights [ i ] = weights [ i ] + ( cumulativeWeights [ i - 1 ] || 0 ) ; } const maxCumulativeWeight = cumulativeWeights [ cumulativeWeights . length - 1 ] ; const randomNumber = maxCumulativeWeight * Math . random ( ) ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < items . length ; i += 1 ) { if ( cumulativeWeights [ i ] >= randomNumber ) { return { item : items [ i ] , index : i , } ; } } return { item : items [ items . length - 1 ] , index : items . length - 1 , } ; } ;

The usage of this function is pretty straightforward. Let's say you really like bananas and want to eat them more often than strawberries. Then you may call const fruit = weightedRandom(['banana', 'strawberry'], [9, 1]) , and in ≈9 out of 10 cases the fruit variable will be equal to banana , and only in ≈1 out of 10 times it will be equal to strawberry .

To avoid losing the best individuums (let's call them champions) during the mating process we may also introduce a so-called longLivingChampionsPercentage parameter. For example, if the longLivingChampionsPercentage = 10 , then 10% of the best cars from the previous population will be carried over to the new generation. You may think about it as there are some long-living individuums that can live a long life and see their children and even grandchildren.

Here is the actual implementation of the select() function:

type Percentage = number ; type SelectionOptions = { mutationProbability : Probability , longLivingChampionsPercentage : Percentage , } ; function select ( generation : Generation , fitness : FitnessFunction , options : SelectionOptions , ) { const { mutationProbability , longLivingChampionsPercentage , } = options ; const newGeneration : Generation = [ ] ; const oldGeneration = [ ... generation ] ; oldGeneration . sort ( ( genomeA : Genome , genomeB : Genome ) : number => { const fitnessA = fitness ( genomeA ) ; const fitnessB = fitness ( genomeB ) ; if ( fitnessA < fitnessB ) { return 1 ; } if ( fitnessA > fitnessB ) { return - 1 ; } return 0 ; } ) ; const longLiversCount = Math . floor ( longLivingChampionsPercentage * oldGeneration . length / 100 ) ; if ( longLiversCount ) { oldGeneration . slice ( 0 , longLiversCount ) . forEach ( ( longLivingGenome : Genome ) => { newGeneration . push ( longLivingGenome ) ; } ) ; } const fitnessPerOldGenome : number [ ] = oldGeneration . map ( ( genome : Genome ) => fitness ( genome ) ) ; while ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { let father : Genome | null = null ; let fatherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; let mother : Genome | null = null ; let matherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; while ( ! father || ! mother || fatherGenomeIndex === matherGenomeIndex ) { const { item : randomFather , index : randomFatherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; const { item : randomMother , index : randomMotherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; father = randomFather ; fatherGenomeIndex = randomFatherGenomeIndex ; mother = randomMother ; matherGenomeIndex = randomMotherGenomeIndex ; } const [ firstChild , secondChild ] = mate ( father , mother , mutationProbability ) ; newGeneration . push ( firstChild ) ; if ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { newGeneration . push ( secondChild ) ; } } return newGeneration ; }

Fitness function

The fitness of the car will be defined by the distance from the car to the parking spot. The higher the distance, the lower the fitness.

The final distance we will calculate is an average distance from 4 car wheels to the correspondent 4 corners of the parking spot. This distance we will call the loss which is inversely proportional to the fitness .

Calculating the distance between each wheel and each corner separately (instead of just calculating the distance from the car center to the parking spot center) will make the car preserve the proper orientation relative to the parking spot.

The distance between two points in space will be calculated based on the Pythagorean theorem like this:

type NumVec3 = [ number , number , number ] ; const euclideanDistance = ( from : NumVec3 , to : NumVec3 ) => { const fromX = from [ 0 ] ; const fromZ = from [ 2 ] ; const toX = to [ 0 ] ; const toZ = to [ 2 ] ; return Math . sqrt ( ( fromX - toX ) ** 2 + ( fromZ - toZ ) ** 2 ) ; } ;

The distance (the loss ) between the car and the parking spot will be calculated like this:

type RectanglePoints = { fl : NumVec3 , fr : NumVec3 , bl : NumVec3 , br : NumVec3 , } ; type GeometricParams = { wheelsPosition : RectanglePoints , parkingLotCorners : RectanglePoints , } ; const carLoss = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const { wheelsPosition , parkingLotCorners } = params ; const { fl : flWheel , fr : frWheel , br : brWheel , bl : blWheel , } = wheelsPosition ; const { fl : flCorner , fr : frCorner , br : brCorner , bl : blCorner , } = parkingLotCorners ; const flDistance = euclideanDistance ( flWheel , flCorner ) ; const frDistance = euclideanDistance ( frWheel , frCorner ) ; const brDistance = euclideanDistance ( brWheel , brCorner ) ; const blDistance = euclideanDistance ( blWheel , blCorner ) ; return ( flDistance + frDistance + brDistance + blDistance ) / 4 ; } ;

Since the fitness should be inversely proportional to the loss we'll calculate it like this:

const carFitness = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const loss = carLoss ( params ) ; return 1 / ( loss + 1 ) ; } ;

You may see the fitness and the loss values for a specific genome and for a current car position on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Launching the evolution

Let's put the evolution functions together. We're going to ""create the world"", launch the evolution loop, make the time going, the generation evolving, and the cars learning how to park.

To get the fitness values of each car we need to run a simulation of the cars behavior in a virtual 3D world. The Evolution Simulator does exactly that - it runs the code below in the simulator, which is made with Three.js:

const GENERATION_SIZE = 1000 ; const LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE = 6 ; const MUTATION_PROBABILITY = 0.04 ; const MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM = 40 ; const carFitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) : number => { const genomeKey = genome . join ( '' ) ; return fitnessValues [ genomeKey ] ; } ; let generationIndex = 0 ; let generation : Generation = createGeneration ( { generationSize : GENERATION_SIZE , genomeLength : GENOME_LENGTH , } ) ; while ( generationIndex < MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM ) { generation = select ( generation , carFitnessFunction , { mutationProbability : MUTATION_PROBABILITY , longLivingChampionsPercentage : LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE , } , ) ; generationIndex += 1 ; } const fittestCar = generation [ 0 ] ;

After running the select() function, the generation array is sorted by the fitness values in descending order. Therefore, the fittest car will always be the first car in the array.

The 1st generation of cars with random genomes will behave something like this:

On the ≈40th generation the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot:

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

The cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so you may give the cars some more time to learn.

From generation to generation we may see how the loss values are going down (which means that fitness values are going up). The P50 Avg Loss shows the average loss value (average distance from the cars to the parking spot) of the 50% of fittest cars. The Min Loss shows the loss value of the fittest car in each generation.

You may see that on average the 50% of the fittest cars of the generation are learning to get closer to the parking spot (from 5.5m away from the parking spot to 3.5m in 35 generations). The trend for the Min Loss values is less obvious (from 1m to 0.5m with some noise signals), however from the animations above you may see that cars have learned some basic parking moves.

Conclusion

In this article, we've broken down the high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level task of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeroes (finding the optimal car genome).

Then we've applied the genetic algorithm to find the optimal car genome. It allowed us to get pretty good results in several hours of simulation (instead of many years of running the naive approach).

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The full genetic source code that was shown in this article may also be found in the Evolution Simulator repository. If you are one of those folks who will actually count and check the number of lines to make sure there are less than 500 of them (excluding tests), please feel free to check the code here 🥸.

There are still some unresolved issues with the code and the simulator:

The car's brain is oversimplified and it uses linear equations instead of, let's say, neural networks. It makes the car not adaptable to the new surroundings or to the new parking lot types.

We don't decrease the car's fitness value when the car is hitting the other car. Therefore the car doesn't ""feel"" any guilt in creating the road accident.

The evolution simulator is not stable. It means that the same car genome may produce different fitness values, which makes the evolution less efficient.

The evolution simulator is also very heavy in terms of performance, which slows down the evolution progress since we can't train, let's say, 1000 cars at once.

Also the Evolution Simulator requires the browser tab to be open and active to perform the simulation.

and more...

However, the purpose of this article was to have some fun while learning how the genetic algorithm works and not to build a production-ready self-parking Teslas. So, even with the issues mentioned above, I hope you've had a good time going through the article.","['generation', 'brain', '500', 'lines', 'const', 'length', 'function', 'car', 'genome', 'code', 'cars', 'return', 'number', 'selfparking']","Self-Parking Car in 500 Lines of Code28 September, 2021 15 min to readIn this article, we'll train the car to do self-parking using a genetic algorithm.

27,Swedish artist under police protection dies in road accident,"Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, has died in a traffic accident, police said. He was 75.

Vilks and two plainclothes police bodyguards were killed in a head-on crash with a truck on Sunday afternoon, said Carina Persson, police chief for southern Sweden.

She said the police car veered into the path of the truck and both vehicles burst into flames. The truck driver was flown to a hospital with serious injuries.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before 2007, when he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

There were a number of attempts on his life over the years.

Police said at this time they did not know why the car drove into the wrong lane but they were investigating whether a tire might have exploded.","['yearspolice', '2007', 'wrong', 'artist', 'dogs', 'protection', 'dies', 'road', 'muhammad', 'car', 'body', 'truck', 'sketch', 'prophet', 'swedish', 'accident']","Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, has died in a traffic accident, police said.

28,Threatened Swedish artist reportedly dead in road accident,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a civilian police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were traveling, news media said.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist's partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Muhammad drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle. He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

Vilks’ life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Al-Qaida put a bounty on Vilks' head. In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden. Last year, a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.","['traveling', 'sculpture', 'artist', 'dogs', 'road', 'reportedly', 'sweden', 'threatened', 'vilks', 'muhammad', 'southern', 'sketch', 'dead', 'swedish', 'accident']","STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

32,Sabah health director lodges police report against woman over 'aggressive' behaviour,"KOTA KINABALU: Sabah Health Director Dr Rose Nani Mudin says she filed a police report against a woman several days after a road accident due to her allegedly aggressive behaviour.

Dr Rose Nani said she had called the police to her office on Monday (Oct 4) after the woman, who goes by the name Shima on social media, came to her office building to look for her.

She added that a report was lodged as she feared for her safety and that of her staff.

In a statement, she explained that the accident occurred near the city at about 9.55pm on Sept 27 when she was on the way home from work.

Dr Rose Nani said she followed the necessary procedure, which was to lodge a police report and then let her insurance company follow up.

She said that on Sept 28, the woman came to her office to make several claims from her staff over the accident.

Her staff told Shima that the matter would be handled by the insurance company and advised her to refer to it for further details.

On Monday, Shima reportedly went to the director’s office again to meet her but Dr Rose Nani was in a meeting.

“I was told that she was aggressive and that was why I decided to lodge a police report,"" Dr Rose Nani said.

Shima also took to social media to complain about the way things were handled, saying she only wanted to meet Dr Rose Nani to settle some matters regarding the accident.

Kota Kinabalu acting police chief Supt George Rakman said the matter was a simple traffic case and as in most situations, the parties involved would need to go to a police station to lodge a report.

From there, statements would be taken and the one in the wrong would have to inform their insurance company for repair and claims purposes.

“Everything will be handled by the insurance company. There is no need for the parties involved in the accident to meet,” he said.

He added that police would not be filing criminal charges against anyone as yet.","['health', 'director', 'meet', 'shima', 'office', 'report', 'insurance', 'aggressive', 'woman', 'dr', 'behaviour', 'nani', 'lodges', 'rose', 'company', 'sabah']","KOTA KINABALU: Sabah Health Director Dr Rose Nani Mudin says she filed a police report against a woman several days after a road accident due to her allegedly aggressive behaviour.

33,Construction worker killed after row with friend,"GEORGE TOWN: A 52-year-old construction worker has allegedly been killed by his friend after a heated argument.

George Town OCPD Asst Comm Soffian Santong said police received a distress call at 2.30pm on Friday (Sept 24).

“We were told there was a fatal road accident at Changkat Minden Height, Gelugor.

“Based on the information given, police immediately went to the scene.

“However, investigations at the scene found that there were no elements of a road accident.

“The police team suspected foul play and that a crime had been committed,” he said.

ACP Soffian added that after the North-East District crime investigation team arrived at the scene and did a preliminary examination, they suspected that the victim had been beaten up.

From interviews with witnesses, he said, they gathered that a 42-year-old suspect had fought with the victim.

“The suspect claimed that the victim said rude things to him,"" ACP Soffian said, adding that this resulted in the suspect beating up the victim.

“Further investigations revealed that the victim was initially lying next to his motorcycle and a witness shifted his body to try and resuscitate him, but failed to do so.

“The forensics team did not find any weapons used during the fight.

“However, there were bruises on the victim’s forehead and a small cut near his right eye.

“The victim will be taken to the hospital for a post-mortem to determine the actual cause of death,” he said.

He added that the case is being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder, which carries the death penalty upon conviction.

“We have identified the suspect and investigations are still ongoing.

“We hope that members of the public with information about the incident will come forward to the nearest police station to facilitate investigations.

“It is learnt that both the suspect and victim knew each other and had been seen spending time together in the neighbourhood,” he said.","['row', 'worker', 'information', 'investigations', 'friend', 'road', 'suspect', 'construction', 'killed', 'scene', 'team', 'suspected', 'victim', 'town', 'soffian']","GEORGE TOWN: A 52-year-old construction worker has allegedly been killed by his friend after a heated argument.

34,HR Ministry to table proposal to provide free Socso protection for 2 million B40 housewives,"KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): The Human Resources Ministry through the Social Security Organisation (Socso) and Women, Family and Community Development Ministry (KWPKM) will propose to the Cabinet to provide free Socso protection for about two million B40 housewives nationwide.

Minister Datuk Seri M. Saravanan (pic) said following discussions, the ministry saw the need to protect the group who had been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, especially when husbands as the family’s breadwinner, could not go out to work.

""However, this will depend on the government's financial position... in this pandemic situation, if the husband is out of work and the wife has some chronic illness, they have no safety net.

""As a government that cares and prioritises the people’s welfare, we recommend that this move be considered to provide two million B40 housewives with a free safety net protection,"" he said after presenting Socso’s benefits to the widow of the late Vijaya Kumaran T. Veerasamy here today.

Vijaya Kumaran died on May 21 after suffering brain damage following a road accident on April 12, last year.

Prior to this, the deceased's medical treatment, which included an implant surgery amounting to RM23,000, was fully paid by Socso.

Earlier the government had agreed to make contribution payments to some 150,000 women in the B40 group registered under e-Kasih.

Meanwhile, on labour shortage in the plantation sector, Saravanan said, currently the country needed 100,000 workers in the sector but the ministry would continue to give priority to locals to fill the job vacancies.

""Foreign workers will be hired as a last resort,” he said adding that priority would continue to be given to locals, despite pressure from the plantation sector employers and the fact that this could affect national income. - Bernama","['safety', 'sector', 'proposal', 'protection', 'table', 'million', 'b40', 'ministry', 'women', 'saravanan', 'workers', 'socso', 'free', 'housewives', 'provide', 'hr']","KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): The Human Resources Ministry through the Social Security Organisation (Socso) and Women, Family and Community Development Ministry (KWPKM) will propose to the Cabinet to provide free Socso protection for about two million B40 housewives nationwide.

35,"Denying driving licences to senior citizens would be a last resort, says Transport Minister","PETALING JAYA: Senior citizens will be issued driving licences if they are able to operate a vehicle and denying one would be a last resort measure, says Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong (pic).

""Retracting or limiting senior citizens to driving licences should be a last resort once it is proven they are unable to drive,” said the Transport Minister.

He said the issue needed a broader and more holistic view instead of focusing on age alone.

""The suggestion to limit motor vehicle licences (LKM) to senior citizens can also result in them only having to borrow another person's vehicle to bypass the law,"" said Dr Wee in a Facebook video on Saturday (Sept 25).

""Referring to isolated incidents or evaluating an individual based on their age would be discriminatory.

""There are also many drivers aged 70 and above who display better driving proficiency than younger drivers,"" he said.

He added that it was also the responsibility of individuals whose health is affecting their driving ability to hand in their licences to Road Transport Department (JPJ) offices.

Dr Wee also called for all stakeholders to come together and create an effective and inclusive plan for all.

On Friday (Sept 24), Bukit Aman Traffic Investigation and Enforcement Department (JSPT) director Comm Datuk Azisman Alias had proposed that the government limit the issuance of Motor Vehicle Licences to senior citizens.

He said this is because the health condition of senior citizens could contribute to road accidents. He said that senior citizens should also undergo a medical check-up and get approval from a doctor to ascertain that they are fit to drive.

“Elderly people are more likely to suffer from health conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and blurred vision, which can indirectly cause a road accident.

“There was a case where a senior citizen was caught driving on a motorcycle lane.

Northeast district police chief ACP Soffian Santong said in a statement on Sunday (Sept 26) that the three men, aged 41 to 57, were nabbed in separate raids in Air Itam, Jelutong and Lebuh Pantai from 5.15pm to 8.30pm on Friday.

""The trio, believed to be friends of the victim, a 52-year-old local male, was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the murder case, which occurred due to a misunderstanding,"" he said in a statement.

He said that two of the three men had criminal and drug records while urine tests showed one of them was positive for drugs, adding that all three have been remanded for five days until Sept 30 over the case, which is being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder.

In the 2.30pm incident on Friday, the victim was found dead, allegedly from being assaulted by another man, 42, after a fight due to a misunderstanding.

37,Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin ethics in question as FAA investigates,"The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced Thursday that it would review Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin over safety concerns brought to its attention by company employees.

The review was sparked by a letter composed by former Blue Origin Communications Director Alexandra Abrams and 20 unnamed current and former employees.

The letter issued a stark warning about the company's advertised mission of wanting to enable a better future for mankind by exploiting space. It claims that Bezos' sales pitch for a Utopian future for humanity is based on a corporate present that is toxic to the core.

The FAA — the nation's top air safety regulator — says it ""takes every safety allegation seriously and the agency is reviewing the information.""

A toxic workplace on a dying planet?

Abrams describes several disturbing aspects of the company, mainly centered around the White male dominated inner circle that runs operations. The letter cites sexist behavior and hiring practices, as well as an exploitative labor system in which those close to Bezos stifle dissent and coerce hopelessly overworked or dissatisfied employees into silence through firings and ever more punitive non-disparagement agreements.

Allegations range from systemic sexually inappropriate behavior, to mental and physical duress. The consistent prioritization of ""making progress for Jeff"" over addressing a myriad of safety concerns brought forward by employees is also highlighted. Moreover, the letter alleges that women are mercilessly badgered for raising concerns.

Abrams also claims she was instructed to make it difficult for employees to ask questions at company town hall meetings ostensibly designed as a forum for open discussion. She spoke of a ""dehumanizing"" work atmosphere in which ""troublemakers or agitators"" were singled out and put on lists given to senior managers as part of a broader system of control over workers.

'Be careful with Jeff's money'

Decision making at Blue Origin, the letter claims, is limited to a select inner circle impatient to publicly display progress while ignoring the safety concerns of some engineers. Requests for more staff, she alleges, were regularly rebuffed, with managers and employees told to ""be grateful"" and to ""be careful with Jeff's money.""

Abrams' letter claims that the desire to beat billionaires Elon Musk and Richard Branson into space compromised safety. She continued by comparing the breakneck pace of launches and the safety issues that ensue, to those of NASA's doomed Challenger program, where seven astronauts lost their lives after safety was compromised by a desperation to launch.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The shock On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after takeoff. It was then the most severe accident in NASA's space program. Challenger was the third of what would eventually become five space shuttles. Before it exploded, the shuttle had completed nine flights.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Just before the catastrophe Space Shuttle Challenger takes off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. Spectators are applauding. Only seconds later enthusiasm turns into horror. Numerous family members and colleagues of the astronauts are among the viewers.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The victims These seven astronauts were killed in the accident (from left to right): Aerospace engineer Ellison Onizuka, pilot Mike Smith, elementary school teacher Christa McAuliffe, test pilot and aerospace engineer Dick Scobee, payload specialist Greg Jarvis, physicist Ron McNair and electrical engineer and specialist for telemetry Judith Resnik.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Inspiration for generations McAuliffe was supposed to become the first teacher in space - and an inspiration for many other students and teachers. In subsequent years, many astronauts carried on with the idea of bringing science and technology back from space into the classroom. Here, McAuliffe is talking to Barbara Morgan during astronaut training. Morgan stayed behind as a backup for McAuliffe.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes A defective seal One or more o-ring seals failed after a very cold night with freezing temperatures and then high temperatures during takeoff. Exhaust gas came out at the side of the rocket, rather than through the engine. Here the head of the presidential investigation commission William Rogers is testifying at a Senate committee. His deputy, astronaut Neil Armstrong, is listening.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Grief and consternation Germany grieved for the dead astronauts as well. Only three month before the accident, the two first West German astronauts Reinhard Furrer and Ernst Messerschmid (first and fifth from left) flew with the same space shuttle. They launched the German-built Spacelab D-1, the first big space exploration project of the Federal Republic of Germany.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Starting up again after a long break Two and a half years after the tragedy, NASA resumed shuttle flights. On December 29, 1988, Space Shuttle Discovery took off from Cape Canaveral. Again there were glitches: Parts of a tank's insulation broke off. Nevertheless, Discovery became one of the most successful space shuttles, and the most used one, too - between 1984 and 2011, it took off 39 times.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The second catastrophe 17 years and 87 space shuttle flights after the Challenger tragedy, criticism of the program had nearly died down. Then a second catastrophe happened: Space Shuttle Columbia broke apart during reentry into Earth's atmosphere on February 1, 2003. All seven crew members died. The likely cause was damage a wing had suffered during takeoff, when it was hit by a piece of fuel-tank insulation foam.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Essential for space research Despite the two accidents, NASA's shuttle program can look back on a proud history: 133 flights were concluded successfully. Here, Space Shuttle Atlantis is approaching the International Space Station (ISS). Without the shuttles, it would have been almost impossible to build the ISS. The Russian Soyuz capsule in the foreground is today's standard vehicle for human space travel to the ISS.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes A small shuttle in infinite space In comparison to the ISS, Space Shuttle Endeavour looks almost tiny on this picture. It is one of very few photos ever taken of a docked space shuttle at the station. Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli had the opportunity to take the shot in 2011 from inside a Soyuz space capsule on the way home from the ISS.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Serving science Space shuttle Atlantis is docking on to the ISS for the second to last time in May 2010. Its last flight took place one year later. By then, space shuttles had delivered uncountable telecommunication-, navigation- and research satellites into their orbit, including space telescope Hubble. They retrieved and repaired satellites and even visited the Russian space station Mir.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Riding piggyback for the last flight Space Shuttle Endeavour flies for the last time - mounted on a special Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet. The plane took the shuttle to its retirement home, the California Science Center in Los Angeles. They took a detour to do a final flyby over the Golden Gate Bridge and several cities along the West Coast. Endeavour had seen its last space flight in May 2011, Atlantis' was in July of the same year.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes And the dream goes on The future of human space travel looks somewhat like the past: The newest NASA spaceship will be Orion. Its design recalls the first Apollo spaceships. The European Space Agency (ESA) will deliver important components for Orion. The new spaceship will be bigger than the Soyuz spacecrafts and also travel farther - to the moon or maybe even to Mars one day. Author: Fabian Schmidt



Safety, according to the letter, is an afterthought at Blue Origin, both in regard to production and environment, as well as to vehicle flight systems.

The employees behind the letter pointed out the extremely limited scope of the FAA's mandate to regulate the space industry, arguing that it must be expanded.

The letter, published on storytelling platform lioness.co, a website which helps individuals bring their ordeals to the media, ended with another, much broader question, namely: ""Should we as a society allow ego-driven individuals with endless caches of money and very little accountability to be the ones to shape that future?""","['bezos', 'shuttle', 'safety', 'investigates', 'blue', 'letter', 'took', 'origin', 'ago', 'jeff', 'ethics', 'question', 'space', 'explodes', 'astronauts', 'employees', 'challenger', 'faa']","30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The shock On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after takeoff.

According to people familiar with the development, the bus was en route from Delhi to UP's Bahraich via Lucknow when it collided head-on against the truck, leading to the death of the passengers. The tourist bus reached Baburi village on Kisan Path in the Deva Kotwali area around 5.30am on Thursday when a truck heading towards it from the opposite end “suddenly went berserk” and collided against it head-on. Splinters came off from the heavyweight vehicles, according to eyewitness reports, owing to the fact that both the bus and the truck were travelling at very high speeds.

Police personnel and officials from the district administration rushed to the spot on receiving news of the accident. As per a report by HT's sister publication Live Hindustan, emergency responders managed to cut off portions from the bus and retrieve the injured from the accident spot.

Bell Bottom will stream on Amazon Prime Video from September 16th. The OTT giant has announced the release date officially. But then, going by the buzz on the social media, audience seems to be not very excited about the film and it may not even excite the OTT audience.

Bollywood filmmakers have been shell-shocked with the response for Bell Bottom and that has sealed any hopes of a recovery in near future. As a result, more and more films are looking at a possible Direct-to-OTT release now. Amazon Prime Video is obviously the beneficiary of such a trend.

So, Bell Bottom has helped Amazon Prime Video in that way even if it fails when it arrives on the Platform.

46,Emma Raducanu joins an illustrious list of teen Slam winners,"Last updated on .From the section Tennis

Emma Raducanu made her tour-level debut in June 2021 at WTA Nottingham

British teenager Emma Raducanu rewrote the history books when she won her maiden Grand Slam title at the US Open.

The 18-year-old new British number one, who has risen to 23 in the world rankings, joins an illustrious list of some of the best-known names in tennis, who hit the big time when they won their first major title while still a teenager.

Martina Hingis is the youngest female Slam champion in the Open era

Martina Hingis - 16 years, 117 days (Australian Open, 1997)

The 'Swiss Miss' is still the youngest female Slam champion in the Open era, winning the 1997 Australian Open by beating Mary Pierce. She went on to win five Grand Slam singles titles in total.

Hingis first retired in 2003 after two ankle surgeries. She returned to competition in non-tour events in 2005 before announcing her comeback to the WTA Tour a year later.

In 2007, Hingis was investigated for testing positive for a metabolite of cocaine and was suspended by the International Tennis Federation for two years.

She made a third return to the sport in 2015, focusing more on doubles, winning four Slam titles in women's doubles and six mixed doubles titles before retiring for a final time in 2017.

Monica Seles - 16 years, 189 days (French Open 1990)

Seles won eight Slam titles before she turned 20, but, in 1993, was the victim of an on-court knife attack. She returned to the tour in 1995 and won another major, but struggled to find her best form. She played her last official tour match at the 2003 French Open.

Tracey Austin - 16 years, 270 days (US Open, 1979)

Austin remains the youngest US Open champion in history and added another title in 1981.

The American struggled with injuries after that and was often sidelined for long periods. She attempted a comeback in 1988 but had a near-fatal road accident a year later. She attempted another return in 1993, but finally retired the following year.

Maria Sharapova - 17 years, 75 days (Wimbledon, 2004)

Famously beat Serena Williams in the final at Wimbledon 17 years ago to claim her maiden major trophy. The Russian went on to win a total of five Slam titles, including two French Opens on clay - a surface on which she famously described herself as being a ""cow on ice"".

Sharapova retired in 2020 after being hampered by shoulder injuries in the latter stages of her career. She had served a 15-month suspension from the sport after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.

Michael Chang - 17 years, 110 days (French Open, 1989)

Michael Chang is the youngest male Slam winner, but despite making two more finals, never won another one

The most notable to win only one is the youngest male Slam champion Chang, who beat Stefan Edberg at Roland Garros in 1989.

Despite reaching a world ranking of number two in the world and a total of 34 career titles, the American was unable to get over the line in the Australian Open and US Open finals in 1996.

Arantxa Sanchez Vicario - 17 years, 174 days (French Open, 1989)

Having followed older brothers Emilio and Javier Sanchez into the sport, the Spaniard upset Steffi Graf to make history at Roland Garros.

Two more Paris triumphs followed - including her last Slam in 1998 - and a US Open success in 1994, while she was runner-up twice at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. She also claimed six women's doubles and four mixed doubles titles before retiring in 2002.

Two years later, Sanchez Vicario returned to play in the 2004 Olympics - her fifth appearance in the Games, from which she has two silver and bronze medals.

Boris Becker - 17 years, 228 days (Wimbledon, 1985)

At the time the dynamic German won his first Wimbledon title, he was the youngest male player to win a Slam in the Open era.

Becker was also unseeded when he started his run, although he was 20 in the ATP rankings as seedings only went up to 16 back then.

He went on to win Wimbledon twice more, plus two Australian Open titles and the 1989 US Open.

Mats Wilander - 17 years, 293 days (French Open, 1982)

The Swede made his mark when he won the French Open as an unseeded player, defeating Guillermo Vilas.

Wilander went on to win seven Slam titles in total with his best year in 1988 when he won three of the four, only missing out at Wimbledon.

He never won the singles title at SW19 but did win the men's doubles in SW19 with compatriot Joakim Nystrom in 1986.

A three-time Davis Cup winner with Sweden, he was handed a three-month suspension by the ITF, having tested positive for cocaine at the 1995 French Open, and retired a year later.

Serena Williams - 17 years, 350 days (US Open, 1999)

Still active and still chasing the elusive 24th Grand Slam singles title which would draw her level with record-holder Margaret Court, Williams has seen her attempts in recent years thwarted.

She won the US Open in her first final, beating fellow teenager Hingis.

She first became a world number one in 2002, but has been troubled with injuries recently. Her last Slam title came in 2017, when she won the Australian Open while in the early stages of pregnancy.

Steffi Graf - 17 years, 357 days (French Open, 1987)

Graf's arrival on the scene was in the years of Martina Navratilova's dominance, and the German beat the then world number one for a first French Open success.

She won a 'Golden Slam' of all four majors and Olympic gold in 1988, finishing with 22 major singles titles in her career.

Knee and wrist injuries beset the latter stages of her career and she retired at the age of 30 in 1999, when she was still ranked world number three and had just won the French Open and reached the Wimbledon final.

Bjorn Borg - 18 years, 10 days (French Open, 1974)

Borg's breakthrough as a teenage sensation in the mid-1970s helped make tennis front-page news.

The Swede won 11 Slams - six French Opens and five Wimbledons - and he will be forever remembered for the epic 1980 showpiece against John McEnroe at SW19.

His initial retirement at the age of 26 in 1983 was a shock to the tennis world. He attempted a comeback between 1991-1993, but failed to win a match on the ATP Tour.

Rafael Nadal - 19 years, 3 days (French Open, 2005)

Nadal is the only member of the 'Big Three' of himself, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic to win his first Slam title as a teenager.

He has won an unprecedented 13 at the French Open, together with seven at other majors. Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are all currently tied on 20 Slam titles each.

The 35-year-old has struggled with injury throughout his career and ended his 2021 season last month because of a recurring left-foot problem.

Other teenagers who also won Slams

Pete Sampras, aged 19 years and 29 days, landed the 1990 US Open with victory over Andre Agassi. It was the first of the American's 14 career majors, which included seven at Wimbledon. It was a record total in men's tennis until surpassed by Roger Federer in 2009.

Aged 19 years and 324 days, success in the 1985 Australian Open final against fellow Swede Mats Wilander was the first of Stefan Edberg's six career Slams.

On the women's side, Hana Mandlikova became the second-youngest female player to win a Grand Slam at the time when she beat Australian Wendy Turnbull in the 1980 Australian Open final. The Prague-born player, who was then aged 18 years and 329 days, would win three more Slams in her career before retiring a decade later.

Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova won two Slams in her career, the first in the US Open, aged 19 years and 76 days, when she beat compatriot Elena Dementieva. She also landed the 2009 French Open.

Bianca Andreescu stunned Serena Williams at the US Open in 2019, aged 19 years and 83 days, but has been plagued with injuries ever since.

Iga Swiatek won the 2020 French Open aged 19 years and 132 days, beating Sofia Kenin, but the Polish player has yet to follow that up.

American Chris Evert claimed the first of her 18 singles Grand Slams when she beat Olga Morozova in the 1974 French Open final at the age of 19 years and 176 days.

Iva Majoli upset Martina Hingis to win her only Slam title in the 1997 French Open aged 19 years and 299 days, ending Hingis' 37-match winning streak and handing the Swiss her first defeat in a Grand Slam final.

47,Let's talk about sex — in space,"German astronaut Matthias Maurer breezes through interviews, rarely missing a beat when he answers journalists' questions around his upcoming six-month trip to the International Space Station (ISS). But one topic throws even Maurer off momentarily: sex drive in space.

""We haven't talked about this, because it's a professional environment,"" he replied to DW's question on whether astronauts exchange insights on how to handle their desires.

Thanks to commercial spaceflights, more people are entering the cosmos than ever before. Just this past week,SpaceX launched four tourists through the Earth's orbit. Ten years from now, the first crew of astronauts will likely set off on a mission to Mars that could last multiple years.

Sexuality is intrinsic to human nature and inevitably factors into space missions. But while space science is progressing, our understanding of sex in space is still basic.

NASA, the US' National Aeronautics and Space Administration, insists that no humans have had sex in space, and American astronauts famously avoid the topic. The few experiments that have been conducted on space sex focused on animals, not humans.

""We need to know more about sexuality in space if we are serious about long-duration space flights. Sexuality is very possibly going to be a part of that,"" Paul Root Wolpe, who spent 15 years as a senior bioethicist at NASA, told DW.

German astronaut Matthias Maurer told DW that there is no official training on sexuality in space

Sex in space matters

Addressing sexuality in space isn't just important because it's what's on everyone's mind. Asked by DW whether sexuality is part of an astronaut's training, Matthias Maurer replied: ""No, but maybe it should be.""

""If we look at sexual health as a core component of health, it's important to understand the conditions we are putting individuals in,"" Saralyn Mark, former senior medical adviser to NASA, told DW.

Sex and masturbation are linked to physical and mental health — that doesn't change in space.

Ejaculation is essential for men to avoid the risk of bacteria building up in their prostate, and orgasms have been shown to relieve stress and anxiety as well as improve sleep quality, which likely helps during a high-pressure space mission.

Has it already happened?

We can only speculate, but it seems likely that sex in space has already happened. There are two space missions that jump out as candidates for the first cosmic coitus.

In 1982, Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, the second-ever woman in space, joined the Soyuz T-7 space mission for eight days. Two male colleagues were already on board when she arrived, making it the first coed space mission.

In his book, Höllenritt durch Raum und Zeit (A hell ride through time and space), German astronaut Ulrich Walter notes that, according to the team's doctor, Oleg Georgievich Gazenko, the flight was planned with a sexual encounter in mind.

The second mission in question took place in 1992, when NASA's Space Shuttle Endeavor was launched with a married couple on board. Mark Lee and Jan Davis, both astronauts, met at NASA. They married in secret a year before liftoff. Their joint flight to space was practically their honeymoon.

Svetlana Savitskaya (right), Anatoly Berezovoy (left) and Valentin Lebedev made up the world's first mixed-sex space crew

How is it different from here on Earth?

So, we can assume that sex in space is a reality. But how is it different to ours on Earth? Let's start with the basics: sex drive.

The little publicly available information that we have indicates that being in space leads to reduced libido, at least at first.

That's because microgravity, the weightlessness astronauts experience in space, causes hormonal changes, like decreases in estrogen. Low estrogen levels have been linked to a drop in sex drive.

Unfortunately, most of what we know about hormones in space comes only from tests on men. That's because only 11.5% of astronauts are female, and the relatively few women who have been to space opted to go on birth control beforehand to avoid menstruation. This makes it tricky to disentangle artificial hormonal changes from those caused by space flight.

Another factor in cosmic sex drive is a change in astronauts' internal clock.

""When you're going around the planet right now, every 90 minutes, your circadian rhythms are altered and that alters everything, including your sex hormones and probably your libido,"" said Saralyn Mark.

The science also matches astronaut Walter's on-site experience. In his book, he writes that, during his short 10-day stay in space, he had no libido.

But there's hope: According to Walter, astronauts' sex drive does readjust after a few weeks in space.

Astronauts and arousal

While our knowledge of sex drive is still fuzzy, we have a much clearer picture on whether humans can get physically aroused in space.

Microgravity causes blood flow to reverse its course and move upwards, towards the head and chest, instead of circulating in the lower half of the body. The internet abounds with speculation on whether this prevents men from getting erections in space.

When asked whether space boners are viable, Mark gave a clear answer: ""Yes, microgravity does not affect that path.""

Root Wolpe agreed: ""There is no reason why it should be biologically impossible.""

Ron Garan, an American astronaut who went to space twice, was asked whether erections are possible in space on an Ask Me Anything Reddit thread.

""I know of nothing that happens to the human body on Earth that can't happen in space,"" he answered.

For women, arousal in space is possible as well but getting wet feels physically different than on planet Earth. In zero gravity, liquids collect at their point of origin, meaning they form a blob at the spot where they are secreted, instead of flowing freely.

Astronauts Mark Lee and Jan Davis spent their honeymoon aboard a space shuttle

Velcro and dolphin sex

So much for the biological basics. Now we are left with speculating about the act itself. One thing is certain: Sex in space is a far more exhausting endeavor than here on Earth.

In zero gravity, Newton's third law, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, makes thrusting against each other a real challenge.

""We don't realize how much gravity assists us in the act of intercourse,"" said Wolpe. ""Sex involves pressure. In space, without any counterforce, you end up constantly pushing your partner away from you.""

But where there's a will, there's a way.

In an interview with German public broadcaster NDR, Walter suggested that astronauts could adopt a method employed by dolphins in the ocean, where a third party holds the other two together to prevent them from drifting.

Wolpe has another idea: ""Everything on the walls of the space station is covered in Velcro, so you could take advantage of that by velcroing one partner to the wall. You have to get creative in this space.""","['sex', 'drive', 'lets', 'sexuality', 'talk', 'mark', 'wolpe', 'walter', 'space', 'astronauts', 'astronaut', 'maurer']","But one topic throws even Maurer off momentarily: sex drive in space.

48,Eastern Cape woman found guilty of stealing R330 000 in Road Accident Fund money from stepchildren,"An Eastern Cape woman has been found guilty of stealing R331 000 from her stepchildren.

The money was part of a Road Accident Fund claim made on behalf of the children.

The woman was not the children's caregiver, as stated in the claim.

An Eastern Cape woman has been found guilty of stealing more than R330 000 in a Road Accident Fund (RAF) claim intended to benefit her stepchildren. She has been handed a six-year suspended sentence and ordered to repay the stolen funds.

READ | Durban lawyer arrested for allegedly defrauding RAF clients

Nyameka Mkhatshwa, 49, was convicted and sentenced in the East London Regional Court on charges of theft on Tuesday. The theft relates to a 2014 claim made by Mkhatshwa on behalf of the children, said Hawks spokesperson Captain Yolisa Mgolodela.

""On 14 July 2014, Mkhatshwa lodged a claim with the RAF on behalf of her stepchildren after the death of her husband in a motor vehicle accident. The claim was settled by the RAF and an amount of more than R331 000 was paid into her account,"" said Mgolodela.

However, the court heard that Mkhatshwa did not give the money to the stepchildren.

""In her affidavit in support of the claim, she said that she was staying with the children and was supporting them, whereas she never lived with nor supported them,"" said Mgolodela.

A complaint was lodged with the Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation team in East London for investigation, which led to Mkhatshwa's arrest on 16 March 2021.

At the time, she was released on a warning by the East London Magistrate's Court.

""After several court appearances, she received a six-year suspended sentence. She was further ordered to repay the victims an amount of R100 000 on or before 1 October 2021 and the balance in monthly instalments over a period of 60 months,"" said Mgolodela.

49,Prophet Mohammed cartoonist killed in car crash,"Prophet Mohammed cartoonist killed in car crash

Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks was living under police protection.

STOCKHOLM: Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, who lived under police protection after his 2007 depiction of the Prophet Mohammed prompted death threats, was killed on Sunday in a road accident.

The 75-year-old and two police officers were killed in a collision with an oncoming truck, Swedish police confirmed to AFP.

""This is being investigated like any other road accident. Because two policemen were involved, an investigation has been assigned to a special section of the prosecutor's office,"" a police spokesperson told AFP, adding that there was no suspicion of foul play.

The accident occurred near the small town Markaryd when the car Vilks was travelling in crashed into an oncoming truck. Both vehicles caught fire and the truck driver was hospitalised, according to police.

In a statement, the police said the cause of the accident was unclear.

""The person we were protecting and two colleagues died in this inconceivable and terribly sad tragedy,"" said regional police head Carina Persson.

Vilks had been under police protection since his 2007 cartoon of Mohammed with a dog's body prompted outrage among those who consider depictions of the Muslim prophet deeply offensive or blasphemous.

Al-Qaeda offered a $100,000 reward for Vilks' murder.

The depiction also sparked diplomatic friction, with Sweden's then prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt meeting ambassadors from several Muslim countries to ease tensions.

In 2015, Vilks survived a gun attack at a free-speech conference in Copenhagen that left a Danish film director dead.","['protection', 'car', 'road', 'cartoonist', 'vilks', 'killed', 'truck', 'crash', 'prophet', 'mohammed', 'swedish', 'accident']","Prophet Mohammed cartoonist killed in car crashSwedish cartoonist Lars Vilks was living under police protection.

52,Bride and groom respond to road accident hours before wedding,"On Monday afternoon September 20th, a Muslim bride, Nour Abu Asi, and her groom, Mohamed Byadsi, were driving back from taking pre-wedding photos outside of their hometown of Jatt, an Arab-Israeli town located in the triangle region of Israel when they spotted a motor vehicle accident involving a young boy on his bicycle and a truck. Even though they were dressed in their wedding attire, the couple, both of whom are United Hatzalah volunteer first responders, didn’t hesitate to stop by the accident and provide emergency medical treatment to the injured nine-year-old boy.

“The boy was riding his bicycle when he suddenly swerved and hit the truck causing himself to sustain some serious lacerations and contusions,” said Mohamed. “I didn’t think twice, as I pulled the car over. Nour and I both got out in our wedding attire and rushed over to assist the young boy while we called United Hatzalah’s Dispatch and Command Center and requested additional volunteers and an ambulance. Our wedding activities would be put on hold for a while as this boy needed our help,” he added.

Nour, who in addition to being a first responder for United Hatzalah is also a nurse in Tel HaShomer Hospital, bandaged the boy’s hands while her husband-to-be, Mohamed, checked the boy’s vital signs and took an oral history of his young patient. “The boy was crying and we tried to comfort him while we bandaged up his wounds. He was scared and so we asked the dispatcher to try to get in touch with his parents while we treated him,” said Nour.

When the boy’s parents arrived at the scene, they declined an ambulance transport and instead took the boy to a nearby hospital on their own. They thanked the almost-newlyweds for their help in treating their son after the accident.

When the boy was treated and his parents had taken him to the hospital for further care, Nour and Mohamed got back into their car and headed back to the wedding hall for the ceremony. “Wherever I go and whatever I am doing, I feel a sense of responsibility to help others because I have the training and ability to do so,” added Mohamed. “Wearing my wedding suit, in the middle of my wedding day, that is when God decides to test me and see if I will still live up to my responsibility of helping others. Of course I decided to stop the car and help. What else can a volunteer EMT do on his own wedding day? What better way to celebrate than by helping others? Nour and I didn’t even think twice, we jumped at the opportunity to help. I am thankful that we passed this first test of our marriage together and we helped another person while doing so.”","['respond', 'hours', 'wedding', 'groom', 'road', 'boy', 'mohamed', 'hospital', 'bride', 'didnt', 'parents', 'nour', 'united', 'young', 'help', 'accident']","“The boy was riding his bicycle when he suddenly swerved and hit the truck causing himself to sustain some serious lacerations and contusions,” said Mohamed.

53,Kenyan policeman wakes up from coma to find he was sacked,"A Kenyan police officer has woken up from a nine-month coma to find he had been sacked for desertion.

Neither the family nor the police force had any idea where Constable Reuben Kimutai Lel was - his niece told the BBC they thought he was dead.

But it turns out that he had been the victim of a road accident and had been in one of the country's biggest hospitals all along.

He only regained consciousness last week.

His niece Joan Jeptoo told the BBC of the family's horror as they searched for his body in morgues after they had given up on his chances of being alive.

At one point they almost collected a decomposing body from a morgue that was said to be him.

""We thought he was dead because his phone was off. Early this year we went to collect a body that we were told resembled him, but the fingerprints didn't match,"" she said.

The police officer was admitted on 21 December 2020 as an unknown person at the main referral hospital in the capital, Nairobi. He had no identity documents with him.

Meanwhile, he was sacked from his job, charged in absentia with desertion and a warrant was issued for his arrest. The case was later withdrawn after police failed to find him.

He regained consciousness last week, and although he has still not regained his full memory, he was able to identify himself by name and that he was a police officer - and so the search for his relatives began.

His niece was contacted by police last Wednesday and was told to go and identify him at hospital.

""I found him at Kenyatta National Hospital. He could not recognise me and he could not recognise names of members of his family,"" she said.

The police officer was discharged from hospital last Friday and is recuperating at his home in Koibatek, Baringo county, under the care of his wife and family.

According to the Daily Nation news site, arrangements are being made to reinstate him to the police force.

However, his niece said the constable, in his late 50s, was looking forward to his retirement.","['coma', 'kenyan', 'officer', 'policeman', 'sacked', 'body', 'told', 'hospital', 'recognise', 'wakes', 'saidthe', 'thought', 'niece', 'regained']","A Kenyan police officer has woken up from a nine-month coma to find he had been sacked for desertion.

54,Disabled boy who is also full time carer for unwell dad is denied PIP support twice,"PIP is meant to help people with long-term physical or mental health conditions or disabilities. The support can be up to £152.15 a week - but many severely ill people say they have been denied support

Exclusive: Disabled boy who is also full time carer for unwell dad is denied PIP support twice

A father and son who have arthritis and learning difficulties between them say they are struggling to get by after being rejected twice for Personal Independence Payments (PIP).

Their case shows how easy it is for people to fall down the cracks in the PIP system and not get the benefit they need.

PIP is meant to help people with long-term physical or mental health conditions or disabilities. The support can be up to £152.15 a week.

But many report finding it hard to get PIP payments and are rejected by assessors working for DWP.

Two people grappling with PIP unsuccessfully are David Rhind, 52, and his son Christoper Rhind, 22.

The Rhinds, who live in Aberdeenshire, say the lack of PIP is making a huge difference to their lives.

David has bad arthritis and needs full-time care.

Christopher has learning difficulties and went to a special needs school. He is on medication for sleep deprivation, depression and breathlessness, has anxiety and has thoughts of self-harming, his father said, and has bitten his fingernails off.

David's wife was his carer, before she sadly passed away in November last year after not fully recovering from a road accident.

Now Christopher has stepped in to care for his father, helping him wash and dress, as well as cleaning the house and cooking.

But the reality is that the father and son care for each other.

David said: ""My son is now my carer and I help him as much as I can. He helps me wash, dress and he cleans the house with a little help from me as I can't do much and he helps me down in the village as he can't make a journey alone.

""I write things down for him so he remembers and I help him cook. He does all the lifting, and I tell him the temperature and time things need for cooking.

""My wife showed him how to use the washing machine and when he goes out I have to be with him or he would get lost.""

Christopher had an assessment for PIP in as soon as he left school.

Technically he is eligible for PIP because anxiety, cognitive disorders and learning disorders are qualifying factors for the benefit.

But he never got the benefit, as he was so overcome with worry on the journey to his first PIP assessment that he became ill and had to return home.

He was assessed again on July 17 this year, but was rejected again.

Most recently the PIP assessor said if he can care for his father, he can plan a journey or cook a meal unaided - both signs someone can cope and doesn't need PIP.

David said: ""He's on meds for his nerves and meds for sleep deprivation, and a salbutamol inhaler which he uses now and again. But yet PIP say if you suffer any mental health issue you are entitled to [the benefit], which is all lies - they're uncaring and unhuman.""

The second rejection knocked Christopher's health, his father said.

""As he told me, no one cares,"" David said. ""But he said I'm his rock, and I said he is mine.

""PIP to my son would help him a great deal, as with his medical health it would help him a lot. He has never had any savings as he can't work, and is now my full-time carer.""

DWP has been approached for comment.

Thousands of PIP assessments overturned in court

Around 293,000 people across the UK have overturned a government decision to deny them Personal Independence Payments (PIP) in the past three years.

It stems from a High Court ruling in December 2017 that found the DWP had not correctly followed regulations for the points given for being able to go on journeys.

Claimants should have been awarded the standard mobility rate of PIP if their psychological distress meant they were unable to undertake any unfamiliar journey without having someone with them.

And they should have been given the enhanced rate if they could not go on any familiar journey without support.

But instead the DWP had been underscoring people for this part of the assessment, meaning some didn't qualify for the mobility rate of PIP at all.

When asked about the failures, the DWP said new information came to light at the tribunal.

The department is now reassessing claims and making adjustments that will mean extra cash and a big back payment for many who were turned down the first time around.","['carer', 'david', 'pip', 'denied', 'health', 'say', 'disabled', 'help', 'unwell', 'boy', 'journey', 'dad', 'father', 'rhind', 'twice', 'son', 'support']","Two people grappling with PIP unsuccessfully are David Rhind, 52, and his son Christoper Rhind, 22.

56,Overspeeding leading cause of road crashes – FRSC,"By Steve Oko

The Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, has identified overspeeding as the leading cause of road crashes in Nigeria.

The Abia State Sector Commander of FRSC, Mr. Paul Ugwu who disclosed this in an exclusive chat with Vanguard, cautioned motorists against overspeeding and other traffic offenses.

He said the corp would tomorrow (Tuesday) flag off ’ember months’ safety campaign as part of measures to minimise road traffic offenses in the state ahead of the Yuletide.

The FRSC boss said that the corps would also conduct free vision, high blood pressure and other vital tests for commercial vehicle drivers in Abia during the campaign.

He gave the theme of this year’s campaign as: “Maintain Speed, Avoid Night Travels and Enjoy Quality Road Experience”.

Ugwu said that the target of the campaign was to reduce road crashes by 15% and fatality by 20%.

He disclosed that ambulances would be deployed and positioned along critical corridors of the state during the “ember months to ensure road accident victims are attended to within five minutes”.

The FRSC boss advised motorists especially passenger- vehicles against night travels saying that statistics has shown that most road crashes occur at night.

He also advised motorists to ensure they posses valid driver’s license and vehicle documents, warming that road traffic offenders especially those guilty of lane indiscipline, overloading, drunk-driving, using mobile phone while on the wheel risk prosecution at the mobile court during the season.

The FRSC boss who also threatened to impound mechanically deficient vehicles, advised motorists to ensure they have sound spare tyre to avoid getting stranded on the way.

“Your spare tyre should be your best tyre not any how tyre”, he advised.

He said that contrary to perceptions in some quarters, the corps is not all about catching road traffic offenders but sometimes conduct free safety checks and offer advice without booking offenders.

Mr Tayo Aboyeji, the South-West Zonal Chairman of NUPENG, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos said the union has lost many lives and properties due to bad roads.

60,Funeral details announced for Gorey man (22) who died following collision,"Finlay (right) with his classmates having won the Amber flag for mental health.

The funeral of a young Gorey man who died following a road accident last weekend will take place at noon this Friday in Christ Church Gorey.

Finlay Power (22) will be reposing at Murphy's Funeral Home, The Avenue, Gorey, tomorrow (Thursday, September 16) from 3 p.m. until 8 p.m. The removal will take place on Friday at 11.30 a.m. to Christ Church, Gorey for funeral followed by private cremation.

Finlay from Annagh, Hollyfort, was the son of James and Catherine Power, brother to James and Erin and partner of Nicole.

He had been a member of Gorey Civil Defence for the past two years and had attended a training session with the group the evening before the accident, which took place on the N2 at Edmonstown, County Louth, on Saturday last.

Speaking before news of Finlay’s death emerged, his Gorey Civil Defence colleague Celestine Swords described him as “the sort of lad who was always eager, and he’d help us in any way that he could as a volunteer. He is very popular in all circles and everyone would describe him as a gentleman.”

On Monday, his former principal Linda Dunne said that, during his time at Coláiste Bhride, Carnew, Finlay was a reliable, hard-working young man who “always got things done and was willing to help out”. She said Finlay was pivotal in the school achieving an amber award for mental health and everyone could see the leadership potential he held.

""Finlay would have been instrumental in that and was very generous with his time and you don’t get very many young people who are like that with volunteerism,” she said.

Tributes have been pouring in online and neighbour to the Power family, Cllr Anthony Donohoe, sent his sympathies to the family.

""My deepest sympathies go out to the Power family on the loss of their son Finlay following this tragic incident. There is a deep sense of sadness in the Annagh and Hollyfort areas as a dark cloud hangs over the area.

""By all accounts, Finlay was an up and coming young man and he will be sadly missed,” said Cllr Donohoe.

Gardaí are continuing to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the collision to come forward.

Any road users who were travelling on the N2 in the townland of Edmonstown, Louth, on Saturday evening (September 11) between 8 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. and who may have camera footage (including dash cam) are asked to make it available to Gardaí.

61,Kinahan associate Raffaele Imperiale involved in horror Ferrari crash that killed one man,"Daniel Kinahan’s Italian mafia associate Raffaele Imperiale was the “protagonist” of a serious road accident while driving a Ferrari in which one man died, Italian investigators have claimed.

The claim was made in new documents filed by Italian prosecutors as part of their case against drug trafficker Imperiale.

The 46-year-old boss of the Naples-based Camorra organisation is currently facing extradition to Italy from Dubai where he was arrested in August.

According to prosecutors, one of Imperiale's associates, who was behind the wheel of a Lamborghini, was also involved in the fatal crash in Spain.

But according to one informer who is co-operating with Italian authorities, Imperiale abandoned his car Ferrari following the crash - despite the fact it was worth a six-figure sum.

""He did not show disappointment that the prestigious cars had been destroyed, as he had a lot of money,” the informer has claimed.

The details are included in statements given to Italy’s Direzione Investigativa Antimafia ('Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate'), also known as DIA, from numerous “collaborators of justice”.

These include Carmine Cerrato, the former right-hand man of Imperiale’s fellow mafia boss Lelluccio Amato.

Imperiale had been wanted by Italian authorities since 2016 to serve an eight year sentence for drug trafficking before his arrest in Dubai.

The Mafia Don was secretly arrested in his luxury Dubai villa while he was in the pool with his wife and four children.

Imperiale is a known associate of Daniel Kinahan and was a guest at his 2017 wedding in Dubai.

The Naples review court has now ordered that Imperiale must remain in prison in Dubai after rejecting a request by his lawyers that he freed pending his extradition.

The court made the decision after hearing Imperiale is not a ""simple drug supplier"" but ""one of the pillars on which the whole Camorra organization of the Di Lauro clan splinters rests"".

Prosecutors also claim Imperiale has ties with the leaders of Holland's notorious 'Mocro Maffia', lead by Ridouan Taghi.

Imperiale is believed to be one of the leaders of a 'super-cartel' which controls a major portion of Europe's lucrative cocaine trade.

Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) documents sent to Dutch police identified Imperiale, Dutch mobster Ridouan Taghi, Bosnian criminal Edin Gačanin, Richard 'El Rico' Vega and Daniel Kinahan as the heads of a so-called ‘super drug cartel.’

According to the DEA, Imperiale, Taghi and Edin Gačanin also attended Kinahan’s wedding at the plush Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai in 2017.

The DEA documents described the ‘super drugs cartel’ as one of the world’s fifty largest drug cartels, with a virtual monopoly of the Peruvian cocaine trade.

The documents said the ‘super drugs cartel’ controlled around a third of the cocaine trade into Europe – with the main point of access through Dutch ports.

Born in Italy, Imperiale’s criminal career began in earnest in 1996 when an older brother who died bequeathed him the Rockland coffee shop in Amsterdam.

From here Imperiale is alleged to have embarked on his criminal career by selling ‘soft’ drugs before expanding into cocaine trafficking with Dutch drug trader Rick van de Bunt.

Imperiale was later introduced by Antonio Orefice, a member of the Moccia clan, to Elio Amato, brother of Raffaele Amato, who was at that time one of the top drug traffickers of the Di Lauro clan.

During those years Imperiale earned millions of euros, becoming the point of contact for the Di Lauro’s organization in dealing with drug trafficking cartels in Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.

Imperiale is also known to be a fanatical collector of art works.

In 2016, two Van Gogh paintings, stolen from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in 2002, were recovered in a villa in Castellammare di Stabia, owned by him.

According to authorities, Imperiale was spending a fortune maintaining a lavish lifestyle in Dubai.

In March of this year further evidence emerged of the links between the Kinahan cartel and Imperiale at the trial of Richard ‘El Rico’ Riquelme in Amsterdam.

Judges heard briefly from the prosecution how Kinahan, was a “regular contact” of Riquelme’s and was in a video on a phone seized from him following his arrest and extradition to Holland from Chile in 2017.

In June, Riquelme was sentenced to 11 years in prison after being found guilty of operating an assassination ring and laundering drug money.

His trial heard he had exchanged phone messages organising gangland murders with jailed drug boss Taghi.","['di', 'man', 'italian', 'associate', 'cocaine', 'drug', 'raffaele', 'involved', 'ferrari', 'imperiale', 'killed', 'dutch', 'dubai', 'documents', 'crash', 'kinahan', 'horror', 'van']","Daniel Kinahan’s Italian mafia associate Raffaele Imperiale was the “protagonist” of a serious road accident while driving a Ferrari in which one man died, Italian investigators have claimed.

62,"Three killed, two injured in Bauchi road accident","The Federal Road Safety Corps in Bauchi State has confirmed that three people were killed in a fatal crash that occurred on Tuesday at Dungulbi village, close to the Muslim burial ground site.

Our correspondent learnt that two people also sustained varying degrees of injury in the crash.

The state Sector Commander, FRSC, Yusuf Abdullahi, disclosed this in a telephone interview with our correspondent on Wednesday.

He said the crash involved a Station Wagon Opel Vectra, with number plate DSA-120 AA, and a commercial Toyota Hiace, Gombe Mass Transit, with number plate GME-74 YX.

Abdullahi said, “The incident, involving six male adults, happened opposite the Muslim Burial Ground junction yesterday (Tuesday) around 8.32pm. Immediately we got the information, we rushed to the scene within 26 minutes.

“The crash was caused by a tyre burst and this was confirmed to our men by the passengers who survived.

“The tyre burst led to the crash because when it happened, the driver lost control and then had a head-on collision with the car in the opposite direction.

“The victims were rushed to the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital, Bauchi, for treatment and confirmation. At the hospital, three of them were confirmed dead. Two others sustained varying degrees of injury.

“The driver of the bus, who was trapped, died as a result of the fire, while two passengers in the other vehicle died.”

He explained that the station wagon vehicle was not engulfed by fire, while the Toyota Hiace bus caught fire after the crash happened.

Abdullahi advised drivers against speeding, night travels, and other practices that put their lives and those of other road users at risk.

63,ECOWAS seeks efficient road transportation,"The Economic Community of West African States has advocated an effective and efficient road transport system in the region.

The Commissioner in charge of Infrastructure at the ECOWAS Commission, Mr Pathe Gueye, at the validation workshop for the draft road safety policy for the ECOWAS region held in Lagos, said there was the need for harmonisation of the highway design codes in the ECOWAS region.

He said, “Road Safety is an important element for the security in West Africa and the World. In 2016, the World Health Organisation in its report informed us that there were more than 6,000 cases of road accident deaths. If we bring that to a population of 1,000 inhabitants, we are about an average of three to five death ratio. This ratio is higher compared to the ratio given by the WHO and it is five times higher than what is obtainable in Europe.

“This shows that the necessity for West Africa to take the responsibility of road safety issue seriously is very important. We have also observed that those who are involved in those road accidents are aged between 16 and 25, which constitute the youths of our sub-region.

“Therefore, the ECOWAS Commission cannot fold its arms and continue to watch our youths die. There is the need to harmonise a framework so that the solution can be sought to improve on this situation.”

The Deputy Corps Marshall, Operations, Federal Road Safety Commission, Mr Kayode Fanola, said Nigeria would benefit from the ECOWAS draft policy on road safety.

“We have made inputs into the draft policy where we articulated what Nigeria has done, the legislation we have and the Nigerian Road Safety Strategy was also highlighted,” he said.

He had been a member of Gorey Civil Defence for the past two years and had attended a training session with the group the evening before the accident, which took place on the N2 at Edmonstown, County Louth, on Saturday last.

Speaking before news of Finlay’s death emerged, his Gorey Civil Defence colleague Celestine Swords described him as “the sort of lad who was always eager, and he’d help us in any way that he could as a volunteer. He is very popular in all circles and everyone would describe him as a gentleman.”

On Monday, his former principal Linda Dunne said that, during his time at Coláiste Bhride, Carnew, Finlay was a reliable, hard-working young man who “always got things done and was willing to help out”. She said Finlay was pivotal in the school achieving an amber award for mental health and everyone could see the leadership potential he held.

""Finlay would have been instrumental in that and was very generous with his time and you don’t get very many young people who are like that with volunteerism,” she said.

Tributes have been pouring in online and neighbour to the Power family, Cllr Anthony Donohoe, sent his sympathies to the family.

""My deepest sympathies go out to the Power family on the loss of their son Finlay following this tragic incident. There is a deep sense of sadness in the Annagh and Hollyfort areas as a dark cloud hangs over the area.

""By all accounts, Finlay was an up and coming young man and he will be sadly missed,” said Cllr Donohoe.

Gardaí are continuing to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the collision to come forward.

Any road users who were travelling on the N2 in the townland of Edmonstown, Louth, on Saturday evening (September 11) between 8 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. and who may have camera footage (including dash cam) are asked to make it available to Gardaí.

67,"Pedestrian injured in crash that killed Joburg mayor dies, bodyguards recovering in hospital","A pedestrian injured in a road crash that killed City of Johannesburg Mayor Jolidee Matongo has died.

Matongo's two bodyguards are recovering in hospital.

Police are investigating charges of culpable homicide and reckless and negligent driving.



A pedestrian injured in the road accident that claimed the life of City of Johannesburg Mayor Jolidee Matongo has died.

According to the ANC in Johannesburg, the pedestrian died on Sunday, increasing the death toll from Saturday night's crash to three.

Matongo and the driver of the bakkie his car collided with died on Saturday. According to the authorities, a pedestrian ran into the road. When Matongo's vehicle tried to avoid him, it collided with the bakkie.

The mayor's two bodyguards were injured. They were in a stable condition in hospital.

Gauteng Premier David Makhura visited the two bodyguards in hospital on Sunday, said mayoral spokesperson Phindile Chauke.

""The premier went to see them in hospital this morning (Sunday). They have been stabilised,"" Chauke said.

Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesperson Xolani Fihla said a case of culpable homicide and reckless and negligent driving was opened at the Lenasia South police station and the investigation into the accident was continuing.

Matongo, 46, died in the accident after attending a voter registration campaign earlier on Saturday. Matongo and Makhura spent the day in Soweto on a voter registration campaign, led by President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Tributes poured in for Matongo, who was hailed as a committed and selfless activist for the people of Johannesburg.

Makhura said the mayor's death left him shattered.

Makhura's spokesperson, Vuyo Mhaga, said:

He served as a councillor for many years before being elected as the mayor of Johannesburg. Premier Makhura described mayor Matongo as someone who executed his duties with a cool and calm demeanour and remained committed in serving the citizens of Johannesburg. Matongo's death has left Makhura shocked and shattered. He conveyed his condolences to Mrs Matongo and children, his extended family and comrades.

Matongo was elected mayor last month following the death of his predecessor Geoff Makhubo. Makhubo died from Covid-19 complications in July.

Paying tribute to the mayor, Ramaphosa said Matongo was looking forward to the local government elections on 1 November.

""Nothing could prepare any of us for this sudden loss, which has deprived our nation's economic centre of its second executive mayor in two months.

69,Mystery of 'stolen' North West aircraft parts solved,"The plane parts that were impounded in Mahikeng earlier this week have been released to their owner.

Police and the provincial government say the parts were being repaired at the local airport.

The parts were transported in three trucks.

North West police say they have solved the mystery of three trucks found transporting aircraft parts earlier this week.



After days of investigation, the police and provincial government have determined that the parts were at the GD Montshioa Airport in Mmabatho for repairs, and had not been stolen as many had suspected.

On Tuesday, police in the Mahikeng impounded three trucks when residents raised the alarm after they saw them transporting the parts. Suspicion was that the parts had been stolen.

The trucks had already left Mahikeng when they were intercepted and forced to turn back by the police.

Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Adele Myburgh revealed that, since impounding the trucks, they had discovered who the owner was.

""At first, it seemed suspicious because of how they were driving. That's why we impounded them. But we have managed to determine ownership and, because it is not stolen property, we had to release it.""

'Nothing sinister'

Myburgh said investigations had determined that the parts had been brought to Mahikeng for repairs.

""They (the trucks) were transporting the parts back to their owner after repairs. There was nothing sinister about it, but we just had to be sure.""

The North West government corroborated the police's version of events, and said the parts were being transported from Mahikeng to Emalahleni in Mpumalanga.

The provincial community safety and transport management department said the aircraft parts were scrap metal from planes. It added that they belonged to Anton Grungleigh.

""Mr Grungleigh has for many years been operating the Aircraft Maintenance Organisation at the airport. The company owning the aircraft ostensibly being stolen has decided to relocate to Upington from Mafikeng, and thus transported his properties in trucks from the airport,"" said MEC Sello Lehari.

70,Hushed up: Mzwandile Masina's high speed crash in 'borrowed' blue light car,"A high-speed, midnight road accident involving City of Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina has been quietly hushed up.

Masina was at the wheel of a ""blue light"" VIP vehicle he allegedly had no permission to drive. Metro police were told he behaved as if drunk.

Thirteen months later, investigations have stalled and witnesses warned not to talk to the media about the incident.

Shortly after midnight on 20 August last year, a large goods truck driving down the N12 West highway near Alberton was struck from behind by a black BMW 540i, said to have been driven at high speed.

It was not a serious accident: no one was hurt, the truck was undamaged and the car was scraped along the passenger side, with the mirror broken.

But what turned a minor fender-bender into a political mystery is what unfolded next, as described in written statement from a witness and metro police, and in interviews with amaBhungane.

The BMW was driven by mayor Mzwandile Masina, breaking curfew in a City-owned car he had allegedly used without permission. He was removed from the scene before police investigations had finished and no witness statement was taken from him.

The truck driver, who has asked not to be named, told amaBhungane that he was driving an articulated truck, owned by SF Logistics.



Close to the turnoffs to the N12 and N3, he and his assistant in the passenger seat noticed in their rear-view mirrors that a car had appeared behind them, driving at high speed and swinging across lanes.



""Then I heard a bump and noticed a BMW next to my back tyre on my side.""

He slowed the truck, stopped it and got out. Two more cars stopped behind them, with men climbing out and shouting, ""Mayor, are you alright?""

Masina's wife

They then approached the truck driver, ""saying that I had hit the mayor and they were aggressive. The driver (Masina) approached and he was shouting at me, and people stopped him.""

As the heated confrontation continued, a woman appeared and identified herself to the truck driver as Masina's wife.

""She was very understanding when I explained what had happened and she took him away.""

By now, according to a witness, the scene bore no resemblance to a minor accident, with a number of metro police vehicles arriving, as well as the mayor's VIP protection entourage.

A metro policeman questioned both drivers and recorded a brief summary in an accident report, each driver blaming the other.

""Driver A (the truck driver) alleged he was travelling in the 2nd lane direction west when Vehicle ""B"" drive into him from the left side (illegible). Driver of Vehicle B (Masina) alleged he was driving west on N12 in the middle lane when Driver of Vehicle ""A"" come over to his lane and collided with him. The Driver of Vehicle ""A drive on and he manage to stop him.""

AmaBhungane asked the truck driver whether it was true that he failed to stop after the accident. He said that a heavily-laden goods truck could not be instantly stopped, but that he had slowed it down and stopped further up the road. A second officer arrived at the scene at 00:50.

By then, Masina had departed, and only the truck driver was present. The truck driver provided a sworn statement in which he made an additional allegation: ""Immediately I hear a sound, he bumped my tyre of my back trailer and I noticed he was drug [drunk].""

There is no equivalent sworn statement from Masina in the accident report file. The accident report says drunken driving was not suspected, nor was it tested for.

At 08:30 that morning, a more senior officer, Superintendent Kelobogile Thepa, was told about the accident. She discovered that the BMW did not belong to Masina, but was a ""blue light"" VIP vehicle allocated to the office of the mayor. Thepa was head of the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) VIP protection unit at the time.



In a sworn statement attached to the investigations report, she said that after she found out that the mayor was driving an EMPD VIP vehicle, she notified the chief of police and requested him to intervene.

""He (chief of police) requested a meeting with the mayor where he explained processes of vehicle policy within the EMPD and asked if the mayor was aware that an EMPD vehicle was operated with a valid driving authorisation.

""The mayor expressed lack of knowledge with policies of the EMPD and promised never to operate an EMPD allocated vehicle as he is allocated officers for protection and conveyance.""

More questions than answers

In the 13 months since the accident, no further investigations have occurred. The official position is that it was a minor accident warranting no further examination. But a number of aspects certainly appear to deserve further attention:

Why was Masina allowed to leave the scene of an accident still under investigation?

Why did police not question or record why he was on the road at that hour during a curfew?

Why was he driving an EMPD car without permission?

Why was possible intoxication not investigated when the truck driver explicitly accused Masina of being drunk?

amaBhungane spoke to several people, who were either on the scene or were familiar with the investigation. No one would speak on the record, either because they were not authorised to speak to the media, or because they had been warned ""not to say anything relating to the incident ever again"".



Said one person: ""How can you investigate your boss objectively, a person who can make your life at work a misery. The reality is that there is a lot of intimidation happening at Ekurhuleni.""

Said another: ""The mayor has several personal cars. Why did he take this particular blue light car meant for police officers in the middle of the night? You need a permit to drive a car assigned to police. Is this not an abuse of state resources? When the accident happened, the mayor called his VIP entourage immediately and other senior EMPD officers, and yet this was a minor accident and straightforward.""

Mayor's office responds

The mayor's spokesperson, Phakamile Mbengashe, provided an explanation as to why the mayor was on the road during a curfew.

""On the evening of 20 August 2020, the executive mayor had just concluded a series of service delivery oversight visits in Vosloorus when he was notified of a medical emergency concerning a close family relative in Katlehong, which he urgently attended to. The family member subsequently passed away on the same day, 20 August 2020.""

Mbengashe provided a death certificate of the person showing she did indeed die on 20 August 2020.

The reason Masina was driving the VIP protection car himself was that: ""At the time of receiving the notification of the medical emergency, the executive mayor's protection unit had already completed their shift, and they were no longer in the company of the executive mayor.""

He claimed there was no intervention by the chief of police: ""All EMPD processes were followed in accordance with the department's policies.""

Mbengashe said the South African Local Government Association mayoral handbook, Section 5.1.3.1, dealing with terms for the use of official vehicles, leaves it to the discretion of the mayor to utilise a car at the expense of the municipality for any reasonable purpose.

Sharon Seretlo/Gallo Images

However, this section deals with a specific vehicle allocated for exclusive mayoral use, including for personal purposes, whereas it is not clear that the same provision applies to VIP protection vehicles assigned to the mayor's office.



Section 5.1.3.7 notes that: ""The use of any other municipal vehicle by the mayor is not permissible.""

Mbengashe said damage to the car had been minimal, isolated to only a rear mirror, and the mayor had covered the cost of the damage in his personal capacity.

However, pictures from the accident report show not only a broken mirror, but a long gash on the passenger side, running across both front and back doors.

71,Alleged cybercrime: FG to arraign activist on Adoke’s complaint,"The Federal Government has filed criminal charges against a civil rights activist and chairman of the Human and Environmental Development Resources Centre, Lanre Suraj, at the Federal High Court in Abuja over allegations that he circulated the audio of a stage-managed phone interview with a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke.

According to TheCable, Suraj was also accused of circulating an allegedly forged email attributed to Adoke in which he was said to have communicated with JP Morgan over the OPL 245 transaction in 2011.

The government in the charges also accused Suraj of committing cybercrime.

No date has been fixed for Suraju’s arraignment in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CR/370/2021 and dated October 8, 2021.

Adoke had petitioned the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, over the circulation of the audio and email, which he said were forged to implicate him in the OPL 245 trial in Milan, Italy.

The Italian court has since dismissed allegations of corruption in the OPL 245 deal while the prosecutors are being investigated over alleged falsification and manipulation of evidence.

Tanker drivers begin strike Monday to protest bad roads

Petroleum tanker drivers will commence a strike on Monday over the deplorable state of the nation’s highways and other issues.

This was revealed by the South-West Zonal Chairman of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, Mr Tayo Aboyeji, on Saturday.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the union has lost many lives and properties due to bad roads.

Aboyeji said that all tanker drivers from the union would withdraw their services nationwide.

He said, “This is not the first time that we will signify our intention to go on strike but we have to call it off because it will generally affect the majority of Nigerians but now our hands are tied.

“We are going on nationwide strike because of the deplorable and shameful state of our highways.

“When a truck loads petrol in Lagos, the drivers spend five to six days to get to Abuja because of the shameful state of the roads.

“All calls by the executive of the petroleum unions have fallen on the deaf ears of the government as the highways continue to deteriorate nationwide.

“The increasing rate of fire incidences involving petroleum tankers with accompanying massive destruction of lives and properties of our members and the general public is enough.

“This is because of the government’s failure to enforce installation of safety gadgets on tankers.

This will protect the inflammatory contents of their trucks from spilling over in a situation of road accident.

“We see the failure of the government in this regard as height of insensitivity to the lives of innocent Nigerians and the union cannot continue to hold its hands while our members are getting burnt everywhere and every day,” he said.

73,"‘Titane’ is a Twisted Exploration of Gender, Violence and Metal","Julia Ducournau’s Titane drips with blood and brake fluid, and mixes milk with motor oil. It centers, in its exacting crosshairs, the fragility of the flesh, the performance of gender, and palpable bodily anxieties, all while telling a bizarre story about a woman who fucks—and is impregnated by—a vintage Cadillac, before going on a murder spree and impersonating the long-lost son of a steroid-loving fire chief. Ducournau and cinematographer Ruben Impens capture all of this with a suitably madcap verve, painting gory violence with tongue-in-cheek whimsy, while zeroing in on the emotional core of operatic moments with laser precision. The result is a wildly visceral experience about transformation, one that lingers beneath the skin.

As a child, young Alexia (Adèle Guigue) has a fixation with cars. When her loud impression of an engine distracts her short-tempered father, she causes a road accident, resulting in a large chunk of her skull being replaced with titanium. Fast forward several years, and the adult Alexia (Agathe Rousselle) has become a famous dancer, whose provocative routine involves straddling the hood of a flaming Cadillac. Even before plunging its way into mind-boggling oddities, the film weaves together two male fetish objects—the car and the feminine form—but after briefly impersonating the male gaze, the camera swiftly ejects it from its purview, as Alexia respond to unwanted sexual advances with stark, discomforting violence.

Titane ★★★★

(4/4 stars)

Directed by: Julia Ducournau

Written by: Julia Ducournau

Starring: Agathe Rousselle, Vincent Lindon, Garance Marillier

Running time: 108 mins.

The violence in Titane is specifically penetrative, with hair sticks and chair legs thrust into ears and mouths. While this both subverts and strongly resembles sexual violence, Alexia’s bodily proximity to motor vehicles ensures that it also calls to mind car keys being twisted in ignitions. After all, one of these violent reprisals leads to her being revved up enough to have sex inside—and with—her vintage car, as it bounces up and down. The anatomical specifics are left out of frame; they don’t matter nearly as much as the glowing image of Alexia’s dripping sweat, or the velvet ropes she grasps, or the scene’s phantasmagorical ecstasy.

This is merely the beginning of the film’s physical, psychological and aesthetic overlap between (wo)man and machine. Alexia’s transhumanistic voyage was quite literally planted in her head in a moment of adolescent trauma, and it now resurges at a catalytic intersection of sex and violence. Her body keeps score during her unexpected pregnancy, during which she bleeds not blood, but a black, motor grease-like substance, and during which her womb becomes laced with metal, inviting questions of what parts of herself she might end up passing down to her child.

Alexia’s pregnancy anxiety also coincides with her evading the law by changing her appearance, in ways both as simple as shaving her eyebrows, and as complicated as breaking and misshaping her nose. She soon takes up residence with a lonely firefighter, Vincent (Vincent Lindon), a sad-clown patriarch past his prime, who pumps iron, and whose stoic rejection of grief primes him to accept, and believe, that Alexia is his long-lost son Adrien. Now living as a twenty-something man, Alexia binds her breasts and her pregnant belly, leading to winding scars akin to an ornate car decal, and to an uneasy balancing act. Not only must she put on a masculine performance—after years of performing her femininity for male eyes—but she must also work at a fire station drenched in homophobia and testosterone, while living with a new father figure whose love is both constrained and overbearing, and who eschews emotional expression in favour of physical dominance.

Alexia’s new predicament turns Titane into a transgender parable, not only because of the literal presence of binding and her need to “pass” as a man (which is directly threatened by her pregnancy), but because of how the film’s more inexplicable bodily anxieties are expressed. The specter of Alexia’s bodily mechanization causes her a dysphoric imbalance. It looms over her in a manner that prevents her from feeling wholly masculine or wholly feminine, two warring, binary modes of physical expression to which she is ultimately drawn, and which coalesce inside her in shocking and confusing ways, as the film blurs the lines between our gendered social understanding of pregnancy and technology—of feminine flesh and masculine metal.

This complicated dichotomy arises as early as Titane’s introductory scenes. High-contrast closeups of car parts dripping motor fluid are color timed to resemble festering wounds—these are also placed in close proximity to similar shots of Alexia on the operating table, with blood dripping from her new titanium skull. The film frequently invites aesthetic comparisons between the circulatory systems of human bodies and motorized creations; as Alexia’s story wears on, this visual overlap becomes more pronounced, especially as Ducournau slowly but surely maps it onto more specific car parts, and more specific body parts as well.

The film’s approach to gender and transformation bears resemblance to Isabel Fall’s unfairly maligned “I Sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter,” a piercing sci-fi short story that explores transgender anxieties through a similar lens. The two texts were likely created independently of one another (the short story has been unavailable for some time), but they make for a fascinating pairing. Each one powerfully unsettles its audience, not only by placing gender’s social function under a microscope in a charged and violent setting, but by using vehicular bodies to magnify gender’s fragile and fluid relationship to the tangible and the physical.

This relationship is often expressed through motion—a fitting extension of the film’s vehicular themes—whether through Alexia’s hasty scrambles to cover up her body and her wounds, or through the contrast between her constrained stillness as the stone-faced Adrien and her eventual return to provocative dance movements to re-assert and re-ignite her femininity. She isn’t the only character to be framed this way; several young firemen are caught in a similar bodily battle. Pulsating musical frolic during nighttime celebrations offers them honest (if momentary) liberation, which clashes with their daytime routines involving their centered, masculine facades. Perhaps most moving of all is the way Vincent fits this mold, as a man torn between his steroid-fueled workouts—which he uses to suppress his emotions and reinforce his denial—and his submission to rhythmic intoxication, his soul set ablaze by a wash of neon light. It may not be long before Titane is programmed as a double feature alongside Beau Travail.

Throughout these physical and emotional transformations, Agathe Rousselle and Vincent Lindon throw themselves into their parts with full force. However, to discuss each role separately would be a purely logistical examination of an emotional whole, of which they form to two inextricable halves. As Alexia/Adrien and Fire Captain Vincent, they portray a remarkable balance between nigh-impenetrable emotional exteriors, and fleeting glimmers of vulnerable longing, for someone who truly understands them—their bodies, and their souls—a desire which Ducournau punctuates in the form of gorgeously detailed character portraits, often filmed in slow motion, amidst a sea of frenzy in an otherwise crowded frame.

Alexia and Vincent’s dynamic isn’t quite as simple as a man and a woman who gradually meet in the middle of a spectrum, but their respective self-actualizations are dependent on one another in unexpected ways. This paves the path for a relationship that starts out absurd, walks a fine line between surreal and familiar—including one particularly side-splitting use of “Macarena”—but soon gives way to complex intimacy, to surprising gentleness, and ultimately, to a stunning emotional crescendo that brings each of the film’s lofty themes full circle.

Strange, frequently haunting, occasionally hilarious and ultimately masterful, Titane is a journey whose head-spinning complications are a vital part of its emotional impact. Wrapping one’s mind around its outlandish elements demands actively re-calibrating cinematic expectations—and in the process, opening the mind and body to more introspective responses to the film’s most visceral, most nauseating and most thrilling scenes.

While this both subverts and strongly resembles sexual violence, Alexia’s bodily proximity to motor vehicles ensures that it also calls to mind car keys being twisted in ignitions.

74,Threatened Swedish Mohammed cartoon artist and two police officers killed in road accident,"THE SWEDISH ARTIST Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Mohammed with a dog’s body brought death threats, has died in a road crash.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were travelling.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist’s partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Mohammed drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle.

He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

Vilks’ life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Mohammed with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favourable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

76,Swedish artist threatened for Muhammad sketch dies in crash,"Police say Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, has died in a traffic accident

STOCKHOLM -- Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since making a sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body in 2007, died in a weekend crash along with two police bodyguards, police said Monday. He was 75.

Vilks and two plainclothes police officers were killed in a head-on crash with a truck on Sunday afternoon, said Carina Persson, police chief for southern Sweden. All three died on the spot. The 45-year-old truck driver was flown to a hospital with serious injuries.

Persson said the police car, which had left Stockholm and was heading south, veered into the path of the truck and both vehicles burst into flames. The accident occurred near Markaryd, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Malmo, Sweden’s third largest city.

“There is nothing else for now that indicates that it was something else but a traffic accident,” Persson told a press conference.

Sweden’s top police chief, Anders Thornberg, said an investigation would take place, but was expected “to take a relatively long time.”

Sweden’s Culture Minister Amanda Lind called called it “an extremely tragic traffic accident.”

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before 2007, when he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Al-Qaida put a bounty on Vilks’ head. In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden.

Since that time Vilks was forced to live under police protection. As Lind put it Monday, “due to the fact that he made use of his freedom of expression and his artistic freedom.""

Over the years he continued to face threats to his life.

In 2014, a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to kill him.

The following year, a free-speech seminar that Vilks attended in Copenhagen, Denmark, was attacked by a lone gunman who killed a Danish film director and wounded three police officers.

Vilks, who was widely believed to have been the intended target of that 2015 attack, was whisked away unharmed by bodyguards. The gunman later killed a Jewish security guard outside a synagogue and wounded two more officers before he was killed in a firefight with police.

Police said Monday they did not know why the car drove into the wrong lane but they were investigating whether a tire might have exploded. The car transporting Vilks had puncture-proof tires, police said.

The accident happened on the north-south E4 highway Sunday afternoon. The unmarked police car apparently ploughed through a cable guardrail separating the north and south-bound lanes, senior police officer Stefan Siteus said at the news conference.

“We have found residues of tire on the E4 before the accident, and we are looking into the possibility that there could have been some kind of tire explosion,” Siteus said.

The vehicle weighed 4.5 tons, which could explain how the vehicle could drive through a cable guardrail, Siteus said. He added that the speed limit at the site was was 110 kilometers per hour (68 miles per hour). An ordinary large vehicle weighs less than 2 tons.

Born in 1946 in Helsingborg, in southern Sweden, Vilks worked as an artist for almost four decades, and rose to fame for challenging the boundaries of art through several controversial works.

His most famous pieces included “Nimis” — a sculpture of driftwood built without permission in Sweden’s Kullaberg nature reserve — as well as Prophet Muhammad drawings, including the one that showed the prophet as a dog.

Vilks initially planned to display the drawing at an exhibit at a Swedish cultural heritage center, but the drawing was removed over security concerns.

It went largely unnoticed until a Swedish newspaper printed the drawing with an editorial defending freedom of expression.

Several of his works, including driftwood sculptures and Mohammad drawings, including the one showing the Muslim prophet's head on the body of a dog, are currently on display in Warsaw, Poland. The works are being shown as part an exhibition curated by a right-wing director which aims to challenge left-wing political correctness.

STOCKHOLM -- The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

79,Dr Karl Covid-19 Australia: Scientist reveals what would happen if you drank vaccine,"Popular scientist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki has revealed what would happen if a person drank a Covid-19 vaccine instead of injecting it into the arm.

Dr Karl, who is dubbed 'the people's scientist', revealed stomach acid would likely destroy a Covid vaccine ingested via the mouth.

'[The vaccine] is optimised to work by a tiny amount of it being injected into the muscle and then various things happen there,' he explained during an interview on Triple M's The Danny Lakey Show.

'The vitamin is not that much, it's less than a mil, so I'm guessing on average, you could swallow it into your mouth, no worries, and it would go down into your esophagus, no worries.

'In the stomach, the extreme acidity may very well break it down and destroy it.'

Dr Karl Kruszelnicki said stomach acid would likely destroy a Covid vaccine if swallowed

Dr Karl, 73, said that while there are vaccines that are swallowed, including for polio, the health industry was moving towards vaccines administered via a spray.

'We're now moving to vaccines that work where the centre of all the action is, the lungs,' he said.

Host Lakey asked whether the vaccine would taste like medicine.

'It's only a mil, half a mil, so it would depend on the individual vaccine because there's so many,' Dr Karl said.

While a human being's stomach acid, enzymes and gut bacteria generally kill vaccine antigens, ingestible vaccines for diseases such as polio and rotavirus exist because both of those are gut pathogens.

Instructions on Covid-19 vaccines stress they should be administered intramuscularly (above) and not swallowed

It comes after the beloved science boffin took to TikTok to share an important message about the risk of dying from a Covid-19 vaccine compared to the disease itself.

'One in a million is the odds of dying from the AstraZeneca vaccine,' the expert said.

The figure is taken from Therapeutic Goods Administration data, which shows there have only been nine deaths linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine from more than 9.6 million doses administered across Australia as of August 29.

The vaccine has been linked to extremely rare blood clotting incidents but Dr Karl said the risk of dying in a road accident is still much higher at 40 deaths in a million.

He said the chance of dying from Covid-19 once infected is 22,000 in a million, 550 times higher than the risk of being killed on Australia's roads.

'22,000 to one. Those are really good odds,' Dr Karl said. 'That's why I got vaccinated as soon as possible - and so should you.'

During Melbourne's Covid-19 second wave there were 18,628 cases and 800 deaths as the virus ripped through Victoria's unvaccinated population in late 2020, according to the state's Department of Health.

Those figures equal a death rate of 42,000 in a million.","['happen', 'scientist', 'vaccine', 'million', 'mil', 'stomach', 'covid19', 'dying', 'dr', 'risk', 'australia', 'reveals', 'vaccines', 'karl', 'drank']","Popular scientist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki has revealed what would happen if a person drank a Covid-19 vaccine instead of injecting it into the arm.

80,Attorney sentenced for stealing R1.4 million in Road Accident Fund payouts meant for his clients,"An Eastern Cape attorney has been handed a suspended sentence of two years for stealing R1.4 million from his clients.

Sonwabo Archibald Hermanus, 55, was ordered to pay back the R1.4 million stolen over a period of five years.

The sentence is wholly suspended for five years, provided that he does not commit the same offence during the suspension period.

An Eastern Cape attorney has been sentenced to two years imprisonment for stealing R1.4 million in Road Accident Fund (RAF) payouts made to his clients.



Sonwabo Archibald Hermanus' sentence was wholly suspended for five years, provided that he does not commit the same offence during the suspension period.

The Mthatha Serious Commercial Specialised Crime Court also ordered Hermanus, 55, to pay back the R1.4 million over a period of five years.

The Hawks said the R1.4 million was deposited by the RAF into Hermanus' trust account in 2013.

The money was meant for Hermanus' clients.

Ramolongwane Patrick Mariri, 48, appeared in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Friday on charges of theft, said Hawks spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu.

The incident allegedly took place in 2017 when Mariri was employed at a Pretoria law firm.

""It is alleged that during 2017, when Mariri was practising as an attorney at RP Mariri Attorneys in Pretoria, he swindled and withdrew over R1.2 million from the attorney's trust fund for personal use,"" said Mulamu.

The funds were linked to a Road Accident Fund payment, Mulamu added.

Mulamu said:

Further investigation revealed that the money was paid into the trust fund account following the Road Accident Fund clients' payment finalisation. The Law Society…struck Mariri off the roll of practicing attorneys in 2017.

A warrant of arrest was issued, and Mariri handed himself over at the Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation office in Pretoria on Thursday.



""The investigation team formally charged him with theft and took him to court,"" said Mulamu.

Mariri was granted R10 000 bail, and the case was postponed to 22 October 2021 for further investigation.

A council sitting will take place on Friday when Moerane is expected to be elected uncontested.

He is poised to replace the late Jolidee Matongo, who died in a car accident two months after taking up the post.

Johannesburg MMC for Environment and Infrastructure Services Mpho Moerane has been endorsed by the ANC's Johannesburg regional executive committee as the party's candidate for City of Johannesburg mayor.

News24 understands that Moerane was ""unanimously"" endorsed at committee meeting on Tuesday after the committee received advice from the legal teams of the Johannesburg ANC and provincial Cogta department.

The committee sought the legal opinion shortly after former mayor Jolidee Matongo died in a road accident two months after taking the post. Matongo was among the longest-serving members of the committee and was previously appointed by late mayor Geoff Makhubo to serve as the City of Johannesburg's MMC for Finance.

83,Dignity for disabled people: They put my little brother in an old people's home... aged 26,"My little brother Omar has always been fearless, pretty much. I'm two years older, but when we were children he was always the first to climb a tree or jump a fence.

I still call him my little brother – but by the time he was in his 20s he was 6ft 1in, with a 14-stone muscular frame who had trained in the British Army. He became a bit of a local hero, too.

He once came to the rescue of a woman who was being robbed at knifepoint – chasing her assailant away.

Yet today, at the age of 33, following a devastating road accident, he faces spending the rest of his life consigned to an old people's home, alongside dementia patients in their 80s.

Eight years ago, Omar's motorbike skidded over a manhole cover, and he was catapulted into a lamp post then a telephone box.

He sustained 27 bone fractures, severed nerves in the neck, arm and back, dislocated his skull from his spine, became deaf in one ear and suffered four brain haemorrhages.

Omar Moustapha , now 33, with his sister, Mariam. Eight years ago, his motorbike skidded over a manhole cover, and he was catapulted into a lamp post then a telephone box. He sustained 27 bone fractures, severed nerves in the neck, arm and back, dislocated his skull from his spine, became deaf in one ear and suffered four brain haemorrhages

He wasn't expected to wake up from a coma, which lasted for a fortnight – but he did.

He spent 16 months in hospital where he had 30 operations, as well as multiple psychiatric assessments as the brain damage has left him with long-term mental health problems.

Omar, my heroic brother, has made remarkable steps to recovery – yet he can't walk longer than a few metres unaided and needs help to wash, dress and do other day-to-day things.

Damage to the nerves in his throat mean he is vulnerable to spasms when eating and drinking, so needs help to prevent him from choking. We've had inadequate help from local healthcare teams, so he is now reliant on our mother, who is 64, and 35-year-old me.

My family has tried everything to get the care Omar desperately needs to live as independently as possible. Ealing Council, in West London, made this impossible from the beginning.

Every request was met with push back. We've written to our MP, James Murray, submitted reports by GPs, surgeons and psychiatrists to support the case for extra help – to no avail.

Mariam pictured with Omar on a night out in 2009. 'My family has tried everything to get the care Omar desperately needs to live as independently as possible. Ealing Council, in West London, made this impossible from the beginning,' says Mariam

The council's only suggestion is for him to go into an old people's home, because specialist services for disabled younger people are so scarce. It's not something he wants to do, not least because he was previously put in one and he felt so desperate he tried to take his own life.

Just over two years ago, The Mail on Sunday revealed that thousands of young Britons with disabilities were languishing in nursing homes.

One woman, 46-year-old Nina Thair, an assistant headteacher from Brighton, was placed in a nursing home for dementia patients when a multiple sclerosis relapse left her unable to live independently. The local council refused to pay the fees – leaving Nina to foot the £4,800 monthly bill.

That shocking story marked the launch of The Mail on Sunday's Dignity For Disabled People campaign, in which we highlighted shocking injustices dealt to some of the most vulnerable people in our society.

And all the while, the nightmarish situation had been playing out in my own house for the previous five years. Despite my role as one of The Mail on Sunday's fitness experts, I haven't written about this until now.

Omar didn't want people to know that he can't cope on his own. But the situation has become so desperate that we have little choice but to speak out.

I hope by doing so people will see that if it can happen to a family like ours, it could happen to anyone.

Omar was just 24 when he became one of the 1.2 million Britons with severe disabilities. I'll never forget the sight of the policeman at the doorstep, and the heart-stopping moment he told us my brother had been airlifted to hospital.

The officer took us to his bedside, while my mother, my younger sister – who has Down's syndrome –and I sat in silence, terrified.

We slept by Omar's bedside for two weeks, preparing for his heart to stop at any moment, while doctors explained that if he did wake up, for the rest of his life he'd be reliant on a wheelchair and an oxygen tank to breathe.

Then came the miraculous moment he began to breathe without a machine – and we realised he might make it after all.

After being discharged from hospital, his care at a rehabilitation centre in Banstead, Surrey, was exemplary. The experts there were teaching him how to, quite literally, get back on his feet.

And it seemed to be working. Having been told he'd never walk again, he'd managed to make it down an entire corridor, picking up one leg at a time using his left arm – the only limb he still has slight feeling in.

It's a fact More than 400,000 wheelchair-users in England live in homes that are deemed inaccessible, claims housing association Habinteg.

The number of disabled people waiting for suitable housing has risen by ten per cent since 2017 to roughly 120,000. Advertisement

But one day the doctor entered his room and told us the local council had cut funding for his care. He had to be out within the week.

Omar had recently split from his wife, with whom he had a two- month-old son and shared a flat, so we had planned that, at some point when he was much better, he'd return to the family home, where my mother and I could look after him. But we weren't ready yet.

His doctors told us our three-bedroom house would need a complete overhaul to meet Omar's needs: railings installed to help him get up and down stairs, a wet room on the ground floor and walls knocked through to create more space. We begged for more time. The answer was no.

Instead, Omar would have to be admitted to the local nursing home, where he'd receive 24-hour care, paid for by the local council.

He was inconsolable, and slumped into a deep depression, repeating 'my life is over,' again and again.

He moved there in late 2015. The elderly man in the room opposite would scream expletives throughout the day and into the night. Many others were dying.

While the rehab team in Surrey had worked hard to get Omar moving again, here, staff did little to help him.

He grew angry, began hitting his head against the walls, throwing objects in frustration and became verbally aggressive.

This behaviour would have left the old Omar mortified – he could be hot-headed, but never, ever threatening. The brain haemorrhages have made him prone to outbursts.

After a few days he phoned our mother, begging us to come and collect him. Back at home, he got even worse.

He could barely balance, as nerve damage to his ankles has made his feet 'lifeless'. Sometimes he resorted to crawling back up the stairs, to be safe.

The council provided a wheelchair, but due to the lack of feeling in his arms he can't use it independently. Splints don't help either, as they cause him pain. Showering became more infrequent – the ordeal of having his mother or sister assist him proved embarrassing.

Terrified of the mountain that was the staircase, he chose to spend most days in his bedroom, increasingly depressed.

According to Government guidance, those with an ongoing healthcare need, such as Omar, qualify for NHS support – but funding and staffing problems mean patients often face delays of several years before accessing essential care and equipment.

A social worker's assessment in 2015 concluded that Omar needed 24-hour assistance and that, given his age and mental health risk, it was important he retained as much independence as possible.

The council agreed to find Omar his own accessible flat in the local area – but even this has been impossible.

Omar is desperate for his own space, away from his mother and sister. Our once enviably close brother-sister relationship is in tatters.

Omar, aged five, and elder sister Mariam playing on go-karts in 1994. She always admired his fearless nature before his accident in 2013

Having to ask his sister to be on hand should he fall when using the toilet is beyond humiliating. And watching me go out to work and enjoy dinners with friends, while his only outing was to the hospital, to have his wounds dressed, has been excruciating.

Omar preferred not to talk to me, or ask for help.

The council suggested sending carers three times a day to help with cleaning, cooking and personal care duties, when my mother and I couldn't manage.

But Omar's brain injury means he is paranoid. He gets aggressive around strangers in his house.

In 2017, the council offered Omar a flat 20 minutes from home – but in the heart of a notorious estate.

At the viewing, we learnt the next-door neighbour had recently been released from prison.

We explained to the council that we didn't feel it would be safe, given my brother's physical and mental vulnerabilities. It also suggested a one-bedroom flat, despite Omar's team of consultants warning against him living alone.

Even when The Mail on Sunday contacted Ealing council to clarify details, they continued to claim he did not require a live-in carer, which made him ineligible for a two-bedroom property.

We've struggled on over the past few years, my mother and I doing alternate shifts, with Omar becoming more and more disengaged with life.

Then, in February last year, while I was out working, he had a bad fall down the stairs and was screaming in pain. In a fury, he dragged himself into my mother's bedroom, grabbed hold of some glass vases on the shelves and smashed them.

Then he attempted suicide in front of her. She called the police, who took him to a psychiatric hospital.

The psychiatrist prescribed antidepressants, and wrote a strongly worded letter to health chiefs in charge of Omar's care, warning of the urgency of his living situation and that he should not be left to live alone.

He came home a few days later, and 18 months on, we're in the same situation. Omar's life has become what he describes as 'a hamster wheel'. 'Every day I wake up, I'm just waiting to go back to sleep. It's killing me inside.'

When our local MP approached the council, asking for a meeting to discuss Omar's case, he was told: 'Sorry, no meetings with politicians at the moment, because of Covid.'

No Zoom meeting, or phone call. Nothing. Meanwhile, Omar's physical condition has taken another dive. In April he underwent another operation on his sciatic nerve, which stretches from the leg to the lower spine.

Ever since, his balance has got worse and he hasn't ventured out of the house in five months, until the end of last week, in the run-up to the publication of this article – which seems to have offered him new hope.

When he found out I'd be writing it, he wasn't thrilled, but agreed because of the comfort he knew it would offer thousands in a similar position. He's made peace with the fact his secret will soon be out. Finally, his voice will be heard.

We can only hope those at the top of the chain are listening.

In a statement, Ealing council said: 'Social housing is in very short supply in Ealing, with more than 11,300 households waiting for a council home.

'We ensure homes go to those who need them most by allocating our finite resources according to priority.

'Mr Moustapha has been in our second-highest priority allocation band since 2016.'

Police and the SPCA are investigating what's been called the ""brutal slaughter"" of 11 rabbits and ducks at an animal shelter in Dairy Flat, Auckland.

Founder of Pixies Animal Rescue Charmain Wolmarans said the rescue animals were killed overnight after a break-in, leaving staff and animals shocked and distressed.

SPCA national inspectorate manager Alan Wilson said the animals appear to have been deliberately killed.

""We are shocked and appalled by this incident, and condemn any senseless act of violence towards defenceless animals,"" he said.

Police confirmed the burglary and said no arrests have been made but inquiries are continuing.

Wolmarans is calling for anyone with information to pass it on to the police or SPCA.

In a Facebook post this morning, she said the shelter needs help to move animals to safety in case there are further attacks. They will not be taking any new animals until the situation is more stable.

Originally from South Africa, Wolmarans started Pixies in 2012 in memory of her daughter who was killed in a road accident at the age of 18.

The animal rescue cares for nearly 400 animals every year.

28 September, 2021 15 min to read

In this article, we'll train the car to do self-parking using a genetic algorithm.

We'll create the 1st generation of cars with random genomes that will behave something like this:

On the ≈40th generation the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot:

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

Yeah-yeah, the cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so be merciful and give the cars some space to grow :D

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The genetic algorithm for this project is implemented in TypeScript. The full genetic source code will be shown in this article, but you may also find the final code examples in the Evolution Simulator repository.

We're going to use a genetic algorithm for the particular task of evolving cars' genomes. However, this article only touches on the basics of the algorithm and is by no means a complete guide to the genetic algorithm topic.

Having that said, let's deep dive into more details...

The Plan

Step-by-step we're going to break down a high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 bits (finding the optimal car genome).

Here is what we're going to do:

💪🏻 Give the muscles (engine, steering wheel) to the car so that it could move towards the parking spot. 👀 Give the eyes (sensors) to the car so that it could see the obstacles around. 🧠 Give the brain to the car that will control the muscles (movements) based on what the car sees (obstacles via sensors). The brain will be simply a pure function movements = f(sensors) . 🧬 Evolve the brain to do the right moves based on the sensors input. This is where we will apply a genetic algorithm. Generation after generation our brain function movements = f(sensors) will learn how to move the car towards the parking spot.

Giving the muscles to the car

To be able to move, the car would need ""muscles"". Let's give the car two types of muscles:

Engine muscle - allows the car to move ↓ back, ↑ forth, or ◎ stand steel (neutral gear) Steering wheel muscle - allows the car to turn ← left, → right, or ◎ go straight while moving

With these two muscles the car can perform the following movements:

In our case, the muscles are receivers of the signals that come from the brain once every 100ms (milliseconds). Based on the value of the brain's signal the muscles act differently. We'll cover the ""brain"" part below, but for now, let's say that our brain may send only 3 possible signals to each muscle: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

type MuscleSignal = - 1 | 0 | 1 ;

For example, the brain may send the signal with the value of +1 to the engine muscle and it will start moving the car forward. The signal -1 to the engine moves the car backward. At the same time, if the brain will send the signal of -1 to the steering wheel muscle, it will turn the car to the left, etc.

Here is how the brain signal values map to the muscle actions in our case:

Muscle Signal = -1 Signal = 0 Signal = +1 Engine ↓ Backward ◎ Neutral ↑ Forward Steering wheel ← Left ◎ Straight → Right

You may use the Evolution Simulator and try to park the car manually to see how the car muscles work. Every time you press one of the WASD keyboard keys (or use a touch-screen joystick) you send these -1 , 0 , or +1 signals to the engine and steering wheel muscles.

Giving the eyes to the car

Before our car will learn how to do self-parking using its muscles, it needs to be able to ""see"" the surroundings. Let's give it the 8 eyes in a form of distance sensors:

Each sensor can detect the obstacle in a distance range of 0-4m (meters).

(meters). Each sensor reports the latest information about the obstacles it ""sees"" to the car's ""brain"" every 100ms .

. Whenever the sensor doesn't see any obstacles it reports the value of 0 . On the contrary, if the value of the sensor is small but not zero (i.e. 0.01m ) it would mean that the obstacle is close.

You may use the Evolution Simulator and see how the color of each sensor changes based on how close the obstacle is.

type Sensors = number [ ] ;

Giving the brain to the car

At this moment, our car can ""see"" and ""move"", but there is no ""coordinator"", that would transform the signals from the ""eyes"" to the proper movements of the ""muscles"". We need to give the car a ""brain"".

Brain input

As an input from the sensors, every 100ms the brain will be getting 8 float numbers, each one in range of [0...4] . For example, the input might look like this:

const sensors : Sensors = [ s0 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 , s7 ] ;

Brain output

Every 100ms the brain should produce two integers as an output:

One number as a signal for the engine: engineSignal One number as a signal for the steering wheel: wheelSignal

Each number should be of the type MuscleSignal and might take one of three values: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

Brain formulas/functions

Keeping in mind the brain's input and output mentioned above we may say that the brain is just a function:

const { engineSignal , wheelSignal } = brainToMuscleSignal ( brainFunction ( sensors ) ) ;

Where brainToMuscleSignal() is a function that converts raw brain signals (any float number) to muscle signals (to -1 , 0 , or +1 number) so that muscles could understand it. We'll implement this converter function below.

The main question now is what kind of a function the brainFunction() is.

To make the car smarter and its movements to be more sophisticated we could go with a Multilayer Perceptron. The name is a bit scary but this is a simple Neural Network with a basic architecture (think of it as a big formula with many parameters/coefficients).

I've covered Multilayer Perceptrons with a bit more details in my homemade-machine-learning, machine-learning-experiments, and nano-neuron projects. You may even challenge that simple network to recognize your written digits.

However, to avoid the introduction of a whole new concept of Neural Networks, we'll go with a much simpler approach and we'll use two Linear Polynomials with multiple variables (to be more precise, each polynomial will have exactly 8 variables, since we have 8 sensors) which will look something like this:

engineSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( e0 * s0 ) + ( e1 * s1 ) + ... + ( e7 * s7 ) + e8 ) wheelSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( w0 * s0 ) + ( w1 * s1 ) + ... + ( w7 * s7 ) + w8 )

Where:

[s0, s1, ..., s7] - the 8 variables, which are the 8 sensor values. These are dynamic.

- the variables, which are the sensor values. These are dynamic. [e0, e1, ..., e8] - the 9 coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static.

- the coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static. [w0, w1, ..., w8] - the 9 coefficients for the steering wheel polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static

The cost of using the simpler function for the brain will be that the car won't be able to learn some sophisticated moves and also won't be able to generalize well and adapt well to unknown surroundings. But for our particular parking lot and for the sake of demonstrating the work of a genetic algorithm it should still be enough.

We may implement the generic polynomial function in the following way:

type Coefficients = number [ ] ; const linearPolynomial = ( coefficients : Coefficients , variables : number [ ] ) : number => { if ( coefficients . length !== ( variables . length + 1 ) ) { throw new Error ( 'Incompatible number of polynomial coefficients and variables' ) ; } let result = 0 ; coefficients . forEach ( ( coefficient : number , coefficientIndex : number ) => { if ( coefficientIndex < variables . length ) { result += coefficient * variables [ coefficientIndex ] ; } else { result += coefficient } } ) ; return result ; } ;

The car's brain in this case will consist of two polynomials and will look like this:

const engineSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( engineCoefficients , sensors ) ) ; const wheelSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( wheelCoefficients , sensors ) ) ;

The output of a linearPolynomial() function is a float number. The brainToMuscleSignal() function need to convert the wide range of floats to three particular integers, and it will do it in two steps:

Convert the float of a wide range (i.e. 0.456 or 3673.45 or -280 ) to the float in a range of (0...1) (i.e. 0.05 or 0.86 ) Convert the float in a range of (0...1) to one of three integer values of -1 , 0 , or +1 . For example, the floats that are close to 0 will be converted to -1 , the floats that are close to 0.5 will be converted to 0 , and the floats that are close to 1 will be converted to 1 .

To do the first part of the conversion we need to introduce a Sigmoid Function which implements the following formula:

It converts the wide range of floats (the x axis) to float numbers with a limited range of (0...1) (the y axis). This is exactly what we need.

Here is how the conversion steps would look on the Sigmoid graph.

The implementation of two conversion steps mentioned above would look like this:

const sigmoid = ( x : number ) : number => { return 1 / ( 1 + Math . E ** - x ) ; } ; const sigmoidToMuscleSignal = ( sigmoidValue : number , margin : number = 0.4 ) : MuscleSignal => { if ( sigmoidValue < ( 0.5 - margin ) ) { return - 1 ; } if ( sigmoidValue > ( 0.5 + margin ) ) { return 1 ; } return 0 ; } ; const brainToMuscleSignal = ( rawBrainSignal : number ) : MuscleSignal => { const normalizedBrainSignal = sigmoid ( rawBrainSignal ) ; return sigmoidToMuscleSignal ( normalizedBrainSignal ) ; }

Car's genome (DNA)

☝🏻 The main conclusion from the ""Eyes"", ""Muscles"" and ""Brain"" sections above should be this: the coefficients [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] defines the behavior of the car. These 18 numbers together form the unique car's Genome (or car's DNA).

Car genome in a decimal form

Let's join the [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] brain coefficients together to form a car's genome in a decimal form:

const carGenomeBase10 = [ e0 , e1 , ... , e8 , w0 , w1 , ... , w8 ] ;

Car genome in a binary form

Let's move one step deeper (to the level of the genes) and convert the decimal numbers of the car's genome to the binary format (to the plain 1 s and 0 s).

I've described in the detail the process of converting the floating-point numbers to binary numbers in the Binary representation of the floating-point numbers article. You might want to check it out if the code in this section is not clear.

Here is a quick example of how the floating-point number may be converted to the 16 bits binary number (again, feel free to read this first if the example is confusing):

In our case, to reduce the genome length, we will convert each floating coefficient to the non-standard 10 bits binary number ( 1 sign bit, 4 exponent bits, 5 fraction bits).

We have 18 coefficients in total, every coefficient will be converted to 10 bits number. It means that the car's genome will be an array of 0 s and 1 s with a length of 18 * 10 = 180 bits .

For example, for the genome in a decimal format that was mentioned above, its binary representation would look like this:

type Gene = 0 | 1 ; type Genome = Gene [ ] ; const genome : Genome = [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , ] ;

Oh my! The binary genome looks so cryptic. But can you imagine, that these 180 zeroes and ones alone define how the car behaves in the parking lot! It's like you hacked someone's DNA and know what each gene means exactly. Amazing!

By the way, you may see the exact values of genomes and coefficients for the best performing car on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Here is the source code that performs the conversion from binary to decimal format for the floating-point numbers (the brain will need it to decode the genome and to produce the muscle signals based on the genome data):

type Bit = 0 | 1 ; type Bits = Bit [ ] ; type PrecisionConfig = { signBitsCount : number , exponentBitsCount : number , fractionBitsCount : number , totalBitsCount : number , } ; type PrecisionConfigs = { custom : PrecisionConfig , } ; const precisionConfigs : PrecisionConfigs = { custom : { signBitsCount : 1 , exponentBitsCount : 4 , fractionBitsCount : 5 , totalBitsCount : 10 , } , } ; function bitsToFloat ( bits : Bits , precisionConfig : PrecisionConfig ) : number { const { signBitsCount , exponentBitsCount } = precisionConfig ; const sign = ( - 1 ) ** bits [ 0 ] ; const exponentBias = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - 1 ) - 1 ; const exponentBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount , signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const exponentUnbiased = exponentBits . reduce ( ( exponentSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - bitIndex - 1 ) ; return exponentSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; const exponent = exponentUnbiased - exponentBias ; const fractionBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const fraction = fractionBits . reduce ( ( fractionSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** - ( bitIndex + 1 ) ; return fractionSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; return sign * ( 2 ** exponent ) * ( 1 + fraction ) ; } function bitsToFloat10 ( bits : Bits ) : number { return bitsToFloat ( bits , precisionConfigs . custom ) ; }

Brain function working with binary genome

Previously our brain function was working with the decimal form of engineCoefficients and wheelCoefficients polynomial coefficients directly. However, these coefficients are now encoded in the binary form of a genome. Let's add a decodeGenome() function that will extract coefficients from the genome and let's rewrite our brain functions:

const CAR_SENSORS_NUM = 8 ; const BIAS_UNITS = 1 ; const GENES_PER_NUMBER = precisionConfigs . custom . totalBitsCount ; const ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const GENOME_LENGTH = ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ; type DecodedGenome = { engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , } const genomeToNumbers = ( genome : Genome , genesPerNumber : number ) : number [ ] => { if ( genome . length % genesPerNumber !== 0 ) { throw new Error ( 'Wrong number of genes in the numbers genome' ) ; } const numbers : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let numberIndex = 0 ; numberIndex < genome . length ; numberIndex += genesPerNumber ) { const number : number = bitsToFloat10 ( genome . slice ( numberIndex , numberIndex + genesPerNumber ) ) ; numbers . push ( number ) ; } return numbers ; } ; const decodeGenome = ( genome : Genome ) : DecodedGenome => { const engineGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( 0 , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ) ; const wheelsGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ) ; const engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( engineGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; const wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( wheelsGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; return { engineFormulaCoefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients , } ; } ; export const getEngineMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { engineFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ; export const getWheelsMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { wheelsFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ;

Self-driving car problem statement

☝🏻 So, finally, we've got to the point when the high-level problem of making the car to be a self-parking car is broken down to the straightforward optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeros (finding the ""good enough"" car's genome). Sounds simple, doesn't it?

Naive approach

We could approach the problem of finding the ""good enough"" genome in a naive way and try out all possible combinations of genes:

[0, ..., 0, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 0, 1] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 1] , and then... ...

But, let's do some math. With 180 bits and with each bit being equal either to 0 or to 1 we would have 2^180 (or 1.53 * 10^54 ) possible combinations. Let's say we would need to give 15s to each car to see if it will park successfully or not. Let's also say that we may run a simulation for 10 cars at once. Then we would need 15 * (1.53 * 10^54) / 10 = 2.29 * 10^54 [seconds] which is 7.36 * 10^46 [years] . Pretty long waiting time. Just as a side thought, it is only 2.021 * 10^3 [years] that have passed after Christ was born.

Genetic approach

We need a faster algorithm to find the optimal value of the genome. This is where the genetic algorithm comes to the rescue. We might not find the best value of the genome, but there is a chance that we may find the optimal value of it. And, what is, more importantly, we don't need to wait that long. With the Evolution Simulator I was able to find a pretty good genome within 24 [hours] .

Genetic algorithm basics

A genetic algorithms (GA) inspired by the process of natural selection, and are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as crossover, mutation and selection.

The problem of finding the ""good enough"" combination of genes for the car looks like an optimization problem, so there is a good chance that GA will help us here.

We're not going to cover a genetic algorithm in all details, but on a high level here are the basic steps that we will need to do:

CREATE – the very first generation of cars can't come out of nothing, so we will generate a set of random car genomes (set of binary arrays with the length of 180 ) at the very beginning. For example, we may create ~1000 cars. With a bigger population the chances to find the optimal solution (and to find it faster) increase. SELECT - we will need to select the fittest individuums out of the current generation for further mating (see the next step). The fitness of each individuum will be defined based on the fitness function, which in our case, will show how close the car approached the target parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. MATE – simply saying we will allow the selected ""♂ father-cars"" to have ""sex"" with the selected ""♀ mother-cars"" so that their genomes could mix in a ~50/50 proportion and produce ""♂♀ children-cars"" genomes. The idea is that the children cars might get better (or worse) in self-parking, by taking the best (or the worst) bits from their parents. MUTATE - during the mating process some genes may randomly mutate ( 1 s and 0 s in child genome may flip). This may bring a wider variety of children genomes and, thus, a wider variety of children cars behavior. Imagine that the 1st bit was accidentally set to 0 for all ~1000 cars. The only way to try the car with the 1st bit being set to 1 is through the random mutations. At the same time, extensive mutations may ruin healthy genomes. Go to ""Step 2"" unless the number of generations has reached the limit (i.e. 100 generations have passed) or unless the top-performing individuums have reached the expected fitness function value (i.e. the best car has approached the parking spot closer than 1 meter ). Otherwise, quit.

Evolving the car's brain using a Genetic Algorithm

Before launching the genetic algorithm let's go and create the functions for the ""CREATE"", ""SELECT"", ""MATE"" and ""MUTATE"" steps of the algorithm.

Functions for the CREATE step

The createGeneration() function will create an array of random genomes (a.k.a. population or generation) and will accept two parameters:

generationSize - defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation.

- defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation. genomeLength - defines the genome length of each individuum in the cars population. In our case, the length of the genome will be 180 .

There is a 50/50 chance for each gene of a genome to be either 0 or 1 .

type Generation = Genome [ ] ; type GenerationParams = { generationSize : number , genomeLength : number , } ; function createGenome ( length : number ) : Genome { return new Array ( length ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? 0 : 1 ) ) ; } function createGeneration ( params : GenerationParams ) : Generation { const { generationSize , genomeLength } = params ; return new Array ( generationSize ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => createGenome ( genomeLength ) ) ; }

Functions for the MUTATE step

The mutate() function will mutate some genes randomly based on the mutationProbability value.

For example, if the mutationProbability = 0.1 then there is a 10% chance for each genome to be mutated. Let's say if we would have a genome of length 10 that looks like [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] , then after the mutation, there will be a chance that 1 gene will be mutated and we may get a genome that might look like [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] .

type Probability = number ; function mutate ( genome : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability ) : Genome { for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < genome . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { const gene : Gene = genome [ geneIndex ] ; const mutatedGene : Gene = gene === 0 ? 1 : 0 ; genome [ geneIndex ] = Math . random ( ) < mutationProbability ? mutatedGene : gene ; } return genome ; }

Functions for the MATE step

The mate() function will accept the father and the mother genomes and will produce two children. We will imitate the real-world scenario and also do the mutation during the mating.

Each bit of the child genome will be defined based on the values of the correspondent bit of the father's or mother's genomes. There is a 50/50% probability that the child will inherit the bit of the father or the mother. For example, let's say we have genomes of length 4 (for simplicity reasons):

Father's genome: [0, 0, 1, 1] Mother's genome: [0, 1, 0, 1] ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ Possible kid #1: [0, 1, 1, 1] Possible kid #2: [0, 0, 1, 1]

In the example above the mutation were not taken into account.

Here is the function implementation:

function mate ( father : Genome , mother : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability , ) : [ Genome , Genome ] { if ( father . length !== mother . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Cannot mate different species' ) ; } const firstChild : Genome = [ ] ; const secondChild : Genome = [ ] ; for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < father . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { firstChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; secondChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; } return [ mutate ( firstChild , mutationProbability ) , mutate ( secondChild , mutationProbability ) , ] ; }

Functions for the SELECT step

To select the fittest individuums for further mating we need a way to find out the fitness of each genome. To do this we will use a so-called fitness function.

The fitness function is always related to the particular task that we try to solve, and it is not generic. In our case, the fitness function will measure the distance between the car and the parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. We will implement the fitness function a bit later, but for now, let's introduce the interface for it:

type FitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) => number ;

Now, let's say we have fitness values for each individuum in the population. Let's also say that we sorted all individuums by their fitness values so that the first individuums are the strongest ones. How should we select the fathers and the mothers from this array? We need to do the selection in a way, that the higher the fitness value of the individuum, the higher the chances of this individuum being selected for mating. The weightedRandom() function will help us with this.

const weightedRandom = < T > ( items : T [ ] , weights : number [ ] ) : { item : T , index : number } => { if ( items . length !== weights . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Items and weights must be of the same size' ) ; } const cumulativeWeights : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < weights . length ; i += 1 ) { cumulativeWeights [ i ] = weights [ i ] + ( cumulativeWeights [ i - 1 ] || 0 ) ; } const maxCumulativeWeight = cumulativeWeights [ cumulativeWeights . length - 1 ] ; const randomNumber = maxCumulativeWeight * Math . random ( ) ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < items . length ; i += 1 ) { if ( cumulativeWeights [ i ] >= randomNumber ) { return { item : items [ i ] , index : i , } ; } } return { item : items [ items . length - 1 ] , index : items . length - 1 , } ; } ;

The usage of this function is pretty straightforward. Let's say you really like bananas and want to eat them more often than strawberries. Then you may call const fruit = weightedRandom(['banana', 'strawberry'], [9, 1]) , and in ≈9 out of 10 cases the fruit variable will be equal to banana , and only in ≈1 out of 10 times it will be equal to strawberry .

To avoid losing the best individuums (let's call them champions) during the mating process we may also introduce a so-called longLivingChampionsPercentage parameter. For example, if the longLivingChampionsPercentage = 10 , then 10% of the best cars from the previous population will be carried over to the new generation. You may think about it as there are some long-living individuums that can live a long life and see their children and even grandchildren.

Here is the actual implementation of the select() function:

type Percentage = number ; type SelectionOptions = { mutationProbability : Probability , longLivingChampionsPercentage : Percentage , } ; function select ( generation : Generation , fitness : FitnessFunction , options : SelectionOptions , ) { const { mutationProbability , longLivingChampionsPercentage , } = options ; const newGeneration : Generation = [ ] ; const oldGeneration = [ ... generation ] ; oldGeneration . sort ( ( genomeA : Genome , genomeB : Genome ) : number => { const fitnessA = fitness ( genomeA ) ; const fitnessB = fitness ( genomeB ) ; if ( fitnessA < fitnessB ) { return 1 ; } if ( fitnessA > fitnessB ) { return - 1 ; } return 0 ; } ) ; const longLiversCount = Math . floor ( longLivingChampionsPercentage * oldGeneration . length / 100 ) ; if ( longLiversCount ) { oldGeneration . slice ( 0 , longLiversCount ) . forEach ( ( longLivingGenome : Genome ) => { newGeneration . push ( longLivingGenome ) ; } ) ; } const fitnessPerOldGenome : number [ ] = oldGeneration . map ( ( genome : Genome ) => fitness ( genome ) ) ; while ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { let father : Genome | null = null ; let fatherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; let mother : Genome | null = null ; let matherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; while ( ! father || ! mother || fatherGenomeIndex === matherGenomeIndex ) { const { item : randomFather , index : randomFatherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; const { item : randomMother , index : randomMotherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; father = randomFather ; fatherGenomeIndex = randomFatherGenomeIndex ; mother = randomMother ; matherGenomeIndex = randomMotherGenomeIndex ; } const [ firstChild , secondChild ] = mate ( father , mother , mutationProbability ) ; newGeneration . push ( firstChild ) ; if ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { newGeneration . push ( secondChild ) ; } } return newGeneration ; }

Fitness function

The fitness of the car will be defined by the distance from the car to the parking spot. The higher the distance, the lower the fitness.

The final distance we will calculate is an average distance from 4 car wheels to the correspondent 4 corners of the parking spot. This distance we will call the loss which is inversely proportional to the fitness .

Calculating the distance between each wheel and each corner separately (instead of just calculating the distance from the car center to the parking spot center) will make the car preserve the proper orientation relative to the parking spot.

The distance between two points in space will be calculated based on the Pythagorean theorem like this:

type NumVec3 = [ number , number , number ] ; const euclideanDistance = ( from : NumVec3 , to : NumVec3 ) => { const fromX = from [ 0 ] ; const fromZ = from [ 2 ] ; const toX = to [ 0 ] ; const toZ = to [ 2 ] ; return Math . sqrt ( ( fromX - toX ) ** 2 + ( fromZ - toZ ) ** 2 ) ; } ;

The distance (the loss ) between the car and the parking spot will be calculated like this:

type RectanglePoints = { fl : NumVec3 , fr : NumVec3 , bl : NumVec3 , br : NumVec3 , } ; type GeometricParams = { wheelsPosition : RectanglePoints , parkingLotCorners : RectanglePoints , } ; const carLoss = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const { wheelsPosition , parkingLotCorners } = params ; const { fl : flWheel , fr : frWheel , br : brWheel , bl : blWheel , } = wheelsPosition ; const { fl : flCorner , fr : frCorner , br : brCorner , bl : blCorner , } = parkingLotCorners ; const flDistance = euclideanDistance ( flWheel , flCorner ) ; const frDistance = euclideanDistance ( frWheel , frCorner ) ; const brDistance = euclideanDistance ( brWheel , brCorner ) ; const blDistance = euclideanDistance ( blWheel , blCorner ) ; return ( flDistance + frDistance + brDistance + blDistance ) / 4 ; } ;

Since the fitness should be inversely proportional to the loss we'll calculate it like this:

const carFitness = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const loss = carLoss ( params ) ; return 1 / ( loss + 1 ) ; } ;

You may see the fitness and the loss values for a specific genome and for a current car position on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Launching the evolution

Let's put the evolution functions together. We're going to ""create the world"", launch the evolution loop, make the time going, the generation evolving, and the cars learning how to park.

To get the fitness values of each car we need to run a simulation of the cars behavior in a virtual 3D world. The Evolution Simulator does exactly that - it runs the code below in the simulator, which is made with Three.js:

const GENERATION_SIZE = 1000 ; const LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE = 6 ; const MUTATION_PROBABILITY = 0.04 ; const MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM = 40 ; const carFitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) : number => { const genomeKey = genome . join ( '' ) ; return fitnessValues [ genomeKey ] ; } ; let generationIndex = 0 ; let generation : Generation = createGeneration ( { generationSize : GENERATION_SIZE , genomeLength : GENOME_LENGTH , } ) ; while ( generationIndex < MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM ) { generation = select ( generation , carFitnessFunction , { mutationProbability : MUTATION_PROBABILITY , longLivingChampionsPercentage : LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE , } , ) ; generationIndex += 1 ; } const fittestCar = generation [ 0 ] ;

After running the select() function, the generation array is sorted by the fitness values in descending order. Therefore, the fittest car will always be the first car in the array.

The 1st generation of cars with random genomes will behave something like this:

On the ≈40th generation the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot:

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

The cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so you may give the cars some more time to learn.

From generation to generation we may see how the loss values are going down (which means that fitness values are going up). The P50 Avg Loss shows the average loss value (average distance from the cars to the parking spot) of the 50% of fittest cars. The Min Loss shows the loss value of the fittest car in each generation.

You may see that on average the 50% of the fittest cars of the generation are learning to get closer to the parking spot (from 5.5m away from the parking spot to 3.5m in 35 generations). The trend for the Min Loss values is less obvious (from 1m to 0.5m with some noise signals), however from the animations above you may see that cars have learned some basic parking moves.

Conclusion

In this article, we've broken down the high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level task of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeroes (finding the optimal car genome).

Then we've applied the genetic algorithm to find the optimal car genome. It allowed us to get pretty good results in several hours of simulation (instead of many years of running the naive approach).

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The full genetic source code that was shown in this article may also be found in the Evolution Simulator repository. If you are one of those folks who will actually count and check the number of lines to make sure there are less than 500 of them (excluding tests), please feel free to check the code here 🥸.

There are still some unresolved issues with the code and the simulator:

The car's brain is oversimplified and it uses linear equations instead of, let's say, neural networks. It makes the car not adaptable to the new surroundings or to the new parking lot types.

We don't decrease the car's fitness value when the car is hitting the other car. Therefore the car doesn't ""feel"" any guilt in creating the road accident.

The evolution simulator is not stable. It means that the same car genome may produce different fitness values, which makes the evolution less efficient.

The evolution simulator is also very heavy in terms of performance, which slows down the evolution progress since we can't train, let's say, 1000 cars at once.

Also the Evolution Simulator requires the browser tab to be open and active to perform the simulation.

and more...

However, the purpose of this article was to have some fun while learning how the genetic algorithm works and not to build a production-ready self-parking Teslas.

88,Threatened Swedish artist reportedly dead in road accident,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a civilian police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were traveling, news media said.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist’s partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Muhammad drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle. He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

Vilks’ life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Al-Qaida put a bounty on Vilks’ head. In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden. Last year, a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.","['traveling', 'sculpture', 'artist', 'dogs', 'road', 'reportedly', 'sweden', 'threatened', 'vilks', 'muhammad', 'southern', 'sketch', 'dead', 'swedish', 'accident']","STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

91,"Rajasthan RTI Activist Dies, Family Claims He Was Killed By People He Exposed","The body was handed over to the family members after postmortem on Sunday (Representationa;)

The family of RTI activist Rai Singh Gurjar, who died in a road accident last week, has alleged foul play, claiming he was killed by people he had exposed in graft cases over the last five years.

Police have registered a case of murder against four to five people on the basis of a complaint lodged by Gurjar's family and began a probe.

However, they said it appeared to be a case of accident and the exact cause will be known after receiving the postmortem report.

The deputy sarpanch of Titarwasa gram panchayat in Jhalawar district suffered a critical head injury in a road accident late Saturday night and died during treatment.

In September 2019, the 27-year-old RTI activist had raised his voice against corruption in developmental work being carried out in Titarwasa gram panchayat, which was adopted by Vice President Venkaiah Naidu under the MP model village scheme in May 2017.

Later also, he continued to speak against corrupt practices by local officials and public representatives.

On Saturday night, Rai Gurjar suffered a critical head injury after his motorbike was hit by an auto rickshaw in Madhopura village. He was rushed to Jhalawar district hospital, where he succumbed to injuries during treatment later in the night.

""There was no mark of injury or scratch all over the body but a deep wound into his head and no mark of accident all over the place, where the accident reportedly occurred on Saturday night,"" Sujan Singh Gurjar, brother of the RTI activist said.

""The deep wound into his head apparently appeared to have been lashed with some sharp weapon,"" he said, alleging his brother was attacked with a sharp weapon and was murdered as he had been pursuing to expose corruption at various levels in different government projects being carried out in the area.

The murder was projected as a road accident, Sujan Gurjar claimed, adding that he lodged a complaint with the police on Sunday against Titarwasa gram sevak Chandra Singh, village sarpanch Kalulal Bheel, who is an accused in a graft case, Dinesh Patidar, who is involved in illegal transportation of soil, and Naipal Singh, a resident of Titarwas village.

An FIR was registered under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC against four to five persons, SHO at Jhalrapatan police station Jitendra Singh Shekhawat said.

The body was handed over to the family members after postmortem on Sunday and the exact cause of death would be clear only after receiving the postmortem report, the SHO said.

Mr Shekhawat, however, said it appeared to be a case of accident.

93,"Chhattisgarh Judge Steps Out Of Courtroom, Awards Rs 20 Lakh Aid To Paralysed Man","The accident victim was unable to go to the courtroom due to his medical condition. (Representational)

A district court judge in Chhattisgarh's Korba stepped out of the four walls of a courtroom to award Rs 20 lakh compensation to a 42-year-old man, who had suffered paralysis after sustaining multiple injuries in a road accident in 2018.

The accident victim, Dwarika Prasad Kanwar, was unable to go to the courtroom due to his medical condition.

District and Sessions court judge BP Verma, who is also the chairman of the District Legal Services Authority, was hearing Kanwar's accident compensation case during the National Lok Adalat on Saturday.

When he came to know about the medical condition of Mr Kanwar, the judge came out of the courtroom and went to the parking area of the court complex, where the victim was waiting in a vehicle, a government public relations officer said in a statement on Sunday.

Mr Kanwar's lawyer PS Rajput and respondent insurance company's advocate Ramnarayan Rathore accompanied the judge to the parking area, where he delivered the judgment. The judge ordered the insurance company to give a compensation of Rs 20 lakh to the victim, the official said.

Mr Kanwar had suffered multiple injuries after his car collided with a trailer in December 2018 at Manikpur area of Raigarh town in the district. He had suffered multiple injuries, including a fracture in the spinal cord, in the accident. After that he had also suffered paralysis. Due to this, he has been bed-ridden and is unable to move on his own.

Mr Kanwar demanded compensation from the insurer saying that his family suffered financially due to his accident.

After the judgement, the victim expressed his gratitude over the disposal of his case, which he said had been pending for the last three years.","['man', 'rs', 'compensation', 'medical', 'aid', 'suffered', 'multiple', 'chhattisgarh', 'awards', 'unable', 'kanwar', 'courtroom', 'judge', 'victim', 'lakh', 'paralysed', 'steps', 'accident']","The accident victim was unable to go to the courtroom due to his medical condition.

As many as two people were killed while 10 were injured in two separate accidents at Dhar Road in the Udhampur district of Jammu and Kashmir.

As per the reports, during the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, an apple-laden truck was on its way from Srinagar towards Punjab. On reaching the Dudar Nallah on Dhar Road, the truck rolled down into the Nallah.

The driver died on the spot while the one injured had been shifted to District Hospital Udhampur and was later referred to Government Medical College and Hospital Jammu for further treatment.

In the second road mishap, as per the reports, at 7 am, a tempo traveller was carrying a passenger from Jammu to Sangaldhan. 10 people were injured after the tempo collided with a truck.

Civil Aviation Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia today announced a new helicopter policy under which dedicated hubs and corridors will be established and landing charges and parking deposits will be abolished to boost commercial operations.

""Today, I want to announce a new helicopter policy for the whole country. We have ten steps that are going to be part of this policy,"" Mr Scindia said during his speech at the 3rd Helicopter Summit organised by industry body FICCI in Dehradun.

Under the new policy, the government will put together a dedicated helicopter-acceleration cell in the Civil Aviation Ministry to look at issues faced by the industry, the minister mentioned.

""It is going to be a resource that you can use to facilitate your growth,"" he added.

The minister said that according to the new policy, there will be no landing charges or parking deposits for heliports and helicopter companies from now.

Officers of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) will engage with the stakeholders of the helicopter industry so that adequate training is given to all individuals, the minister noted.

Under the new policy, an advisory group has been set up in the Civil Aviation Ministry to discuss all pain points of the industry, he mentioned.

Heli-Disha, a booklet released today in Dehradun, will be given to every District Collector of the country, he said.

The booklet has all regulations and issues relating to helicopter size, weight, and operations among other things and it will be distributed so that awareness is created in the district administrations across the country, he added.

As per the new policy, a centralised Heli-Seva portal will be upgraded so that all permissions for a helicopter flight can be granted online, the minister mentioned.

He said the government is going to make four Heli-hubs to start with - one in Mumbai's Juhu, second in Guwahati, third in Delhi and fourth at the HAL airport in Bengaluru.

The minister said 10 cities and 82 routes have been identified to develop helicopter corridors.

""As a beginning, we are going to start with three dedicated corridors for helicopters - Juhu-Pune-Juhu, Mahalakshmi race course-Pune-Mahalakshmi race course and Gandhinagar-Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar,"" Mr Scindia noted.

He said the government has chosen three expressways - Delhi-Mumbai expressway, Ambala-Kotputli expressway and Amritsar-Bhatinda-Jamnagar expressway - along which the heliports will be set up for immediate evacuation of accident victims.

In its early days, the internet was described as an information superhighway. The metaphor has fallen out of use, but it captures an important truth. Highways have rules – speed limits; no drunk driving – because a free-for-all would be deadly.

The damage caused by reckless or malicious use of an information network is not as visible to passing traffic as a road accident, but there is no doubting the problem. A US Senate committee this week heard the testimony of Frances Haugen, a former employee of Facebook now turned whistleblower, on what she sees as the company’s negligent practices. Users of Facebook’s family of products number around 2.8 billion, so it matters to the whole world if they are hazardous.

Ms Haugen has leaked internal research to support her claim that the company is aware of detrimental effects caused by its services – exacerbating mental health problems in young teenagers, for example – but chooses profit over safety. She believes Facebook products “harm children, stoke division and weaken democracy”.

That effect is spread across a suite of applications. Instagram and WhatsApp are also part of the empire controlled by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive. The breadth of his realm was illustrated earlier this week when a technical fault shut down large parts of it. For most users that was a minor inconvenience, but there are places where Facebook is synonymous with the internet. Such power cannot be trusted to a negligent organisation. In Myanmar, Facebook has been a primary conduit for material inciting hatred against the Rohingya minority. The company does not dispute that it was used to instigate violence. But it focuses its moderating efforts on content in the US, since that is where it fears regulation.

The era of utopian romance around tech businesses, when it was claimed that they were connecting people for the betterment of humanity, is long past. The giants of the sector are now viewed as oligopolists, paying too little tax, hoarding personal data and neglecting the social cost of their business model.

Chemical plants are not free to discharge toxic waste into water supplies. Tobacco advertising is restricted. When, in the past, an industry’s product has been shown to cause pollution or ill health, government has stepped in. That process is catching up with Facebook. The task is much harder because the raw material it uses is information and designing regulation for that ends up in a debate over censorship. The boundary between tolerable unpleasantness and aggression against civil society is not easy to discern, as the UK government has discovered. Its online safety bill, as drafted, would hand Ofcom an awkward statutory duty to police the way digital platforms protect “democratically important” content without political bias; restricting harmful material without curtailing free expression.

But British regulation of Facebook is downstream of action taken in the US, where there is a federal move to break the company up to bolster competition. In theory, a challenger in the market could satisfy demand for a social network that takes its social responsibilities seriously. That is some way off, but Facebook’s dominance will not last forever. Its power was amassed in an era when the toxicity of its products was hidden from view. Thankfully, that era is drawing to a close.","['facebook', 'antisocial', 'products', 'information', 'haugen', 'material', 'era', 'facebooks', 'network', 'view', 'guardian', 'social', 'power']","Show caption Frances Haugen, a former employee of Facebook, testifies before a US Senate committee.

103,Mogul of Mystery,"Bride Lane Library/Popperfoto/Getty Images Robert Maxwell at a press conference announcing his acquisition of Mirror Group Newspapers, London, July 1984

Over the past two years—since the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein in July 2019 on charges of trafficking minors and then his suicide in prison; Prince Andrew’s calamitous television interview the following November, in which he tried to dissociate himself from Epstein’s crimes but instead brought his public career to an end; and the dramatic arrest in July 2020 of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s associate and former girlfriend, and her incarceration in a federal prison in Brooklyn—an image has recurred before my mind’s eye. Around ninety years ago a little boy called Jan Hoch, wearing a yarmulke and curled sidelocks, belonged to an Orthodox Jewish community—impoverished, Yiddish-speaking, devout—in the small town of Solotvino in Subcarpathian Ruthenia. His mother wanted him to be a rabbi, and he was destined for the yeshiva in Pressburg (now Bratislava) until war engulfed Europe. Although he escaped, and after many adventures entirely reinvented himself, a horrible fate awaited his family.

That little boy was Ghislaine Maxwell’s father. The story of Robert Maxwell—as Jan Hoch of Solotvino became after he had been variously “Private Leslie Jones,” “Lance-Corporal Leslie Smith,” “Sergeant Ivan du Maurier,” and “Captain Stone”—is so ghastly and so ludicrous and altogether so improbable that it might seem stranger than fiction. There might be echoes from Victorian novels—Mr. Merdle, the “man of the age” before he goes bust in Little Dorrit, or the still more mysterious financier Melmotte in The Way We Live Now—but neither Dickens nor Trollope could quite have invented Maxwell. He was by turns a desperate refugee, a brave soldier, a seemingly successful entrepreneur, a member of Parliament, a newspaper owner, and, as it transpired after his death, an outrageous swindler.

John Preston opens his entertaining and gruesome Fall with a scene earlier in the year of Maxwell’s death. In March 1991 he arrived in New York aboard his yacht, Lady Ghislaine, named after the daughter he had once neglected and bullied but who had become his loyal helpmate and accompanied him on this trip. He was there to pull off what he presented as his greatest coup yet by buying the New York Daily News. Eight months later the yacht was cruising off the Canary Islands with Maxwell aboard until November 5, when he disappeared. Soon afterward, his floating body was found, leaving a final riddle: Accident, suicide, or murder?

This man of mystery was formed by a bleak early life. He was born in 1923, one of the nine children of Mehel and Chanca Hoch, who lived in a two-room shack with a dirt floor. He loved, and was loved by, his mother, but was often beaten by his cruel father, the six-foot-five “Mehel the Tall,” who scratched such living as he could by buying animal skins from butchers and selling them to leather dealers; from him the son inherited his size and maybe his temperament. Much about Maxwell could be understood as a reaction to his childhood, his gluttony and love of luxury set against the poverty and hunger he had once known, his longing for power against powerlessness, maybe even his cruelty to others against the cruelty he had suffered.

Another heritage was his polyglotism. Solotvino lies in a region that during the past hundred and more years has changed hands repeatedly. Between the wars it was at the eastern extremity of Czechoslovakia, having previously been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; it then belonged briefly to Hungary, then the Soviet Union, and now is in Ukraine. Its Jews often acquired perforce several languages, and as an adult Maxwell could speak English (very distinctively), French, German, Russian, and Czech. Any religious heritage, on the other hand, he soon shed. Maxwell might be thought almost what the Irish call a spoiled priest, dropping out of the yeshiva and never again entering a synagogue for most of his life.

In March 1939 Czechoslovakia fell apart. Hitler arrived in Prague to declare the Czech rump a Reich dependency, while Slovakia became a puppet state under Monsignor Jozef Tiso, one of the more repellent prelates of that dark age for the Roman Catholic Church, who was later executed as a war criminal. Then in September Germany invaded Poland. Barely sixteen, Hoch managed to flee Solotvino. Many years later he gave one version of his adventures to a hagiographer, claiming that he had walked to Budapest, been imprisoned, and then fought off his warder and escaped, but he was such a fabulist that nothing he said can be accepted with any certainty. At any rate, he seems to have made his roundabout way to France and the exiled Czech army.

There’s no ambiguity about what happened to his family. Before the war had ended, Maxwell’s mother and father, grandfather, and three of his younger siblings were transported to Auschwitz and murdered. For many years Maxwell tried to obliterate this horror, never mentioning his childhood, origins, religion, parents, or their horrible deaths.

In late July 1940, Preston writes, “in French army uniform, carrying a rifle in his hand and unable to speak a word of English, the yet-to-be Robert Maxwell” disembarked in Liverpool. He had just turned seventeen and still wasn’t of military age, but he contrived to join the menial Pioneer Corps, digging ditches alongside more eminent refugees, German-Jewish doctors and musicians. A brief encounter with a woman shopkeeper helped him learn English, although he said that he had already learned it by listening to broadcasts of Winston Churchill’s speeches before he could understand them and absorbing their distinctive tones, which he fondly believed he could emulate.

By 1944 he had joined the British infantry, after changing his name regularly. The Normandy campaign found him as Sergeant du Maurier, from a popular brand of cigarette, leading a sniper section of the North Staffordshire Regiment with enough distinction to win a commission, and by March 1945 Captain Robert Maxwell, as he had finally become, won the Military Cross ( MC ), pinned on his chest by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery himself. He went beyond the call of duty in his own way. Maxwell much later described one incident when he shouted in German to enemy soldiers in a farmhouse, “Come out with your hands up. You are completely surrounded.” When they did, “I shot them all with my sub-machine-gun. I thought my boys would be pleased, but all they said was, ‘That’s not fair, sir, those lads had surrendered.’”

In Paris a few months after its liberation Maxwell met Elisabeth Meynard, known as Betty, at a servicemen’s club, swept her off her feet, and married her despite the apprehensions of her prosperous French Protestant family. “Long-suffering” is wholly inadequate to describe a woman who stuck with her monstrous husband until the end despite endless infidelities and scandals. They had four sons and five daughters. Ghislaine, the youngest, was born in 1961, three days before the eldest boy was so gravely injured in a road accident that he spent the remaining six years of his life in a coma. The children were treated horribly by their father, who belittled and humiliated them at every turn. At first Ghislaine was the worst victim, to the point that she was anorexic as a child, but Maxwell relented and she became his favorite, expensively educated at boarding school and Oxford, until Betty could call Ghislaine “spoiled, the only one of my children I can truly say that about.”

If the story of young Hoch’s escape from Solotvino was obscure, Captain Maxwell’s career after the war was also murky. He ended up in Berlin serving in British intelligence, which he may have done for some time after he left the army, while possibly working for other countries’ intelligence services as well. “Later on in life, he could never pass a spotlight without stepping into it,” Preston writes, but at this time, “like Harry Lime in…The Third Man, Maxwell seemed to belong in the shadows, slipping quietly from occupied zone to occupied zone.”

In Berlin he also found the basis of his fortune. He helped run a newspaper owned by Springer-Verlag, which before the war had been the world’s largest publisher of scientific books and journals, and struck a deal with Ferdinand Springer, the head of the firm. By then Maxwell had learned of his parents’ death, but as part of his willful erasure of the past he was quite ready to do business with a man who had prospered under the Third Reich. Springer needed someone who could sell his products internationally, and Maxwell was that someone. By 1948 he had secured world distribution rights to all of Springer-Verlag’s publications. Preston writes that “150 tons of books and another 150 tons of journals were loaded on to a goods train and taken to Bielefeld in western Germany. From there, a convoy of trucks brought them to London,” although the figures seem astonishing.

Soon afterward Maxwell bought into a small trading company, but he required the marketing weight of a larger established publisher, and acquired Butterworth, which specialized in medical and legal textbooks. After he created Butterworth–Springer as a subsidiary, he also needed capital, and Major John Whitlock, the head of Butterworth, introduced him to Sir Charles Hambro, scion of a banking dynasty, who “took an immediate shine to Maxwell.” His links to British intelligence may have helped, since Whitlock and Hambro had both served in that twilight world.

In later years not only was Maxwell’s reputation terrible but his personality was repulsive, the embodiment of what his native Yiddish calls grobkeit, boorish and vulgar. But before the passage of time coarsened him he must have been more personable, and for many years a remarkable number of people in the English commercial and financial establishment were taken in by him. With Hambro’s help Maxwell created a British distributor, whose turnover more than doubled between 1950 and 1951, when he changed the name of Butterworth–Springer to Pergamon. Scientific books and journals were a real money-spinner, since universities and libraries needed them, and learned authors didn’t expect to be paid.

Some of the refugees who enlivened London publishing after the war—André Deutsch, Paul Hamlyn, George Weidenfeld—might have been colorful and not always popular with their long-established rivals, but Maxwell was something else again. As he ensconced himself at Headington Hill Hall outside Oxford, Preston says, “darkness—and the whiff of chicanery—was never far away.” Nigel Lawson would one day be chancellor of the exchequer in Margaret Thatcher’s government, but in the early 1950s he was an Oxford undergraduate and found a lowly vacation job working at Maxwell’s warehouse, where he was startled to find that school textbooks rejected as defective in England were being sold in Africa.

For his next move Maxwell went into politics, capriciously choosing Labour, and in 1964 Captain Maxwell added “ MP ” to the “ MC ” after his name when he was elected to Parliament as member for Buckingham. The Labour Party didn’t know quite what to make of this “very strange fellow,” as the diarist, former Oxford don, and future cabinet minister Richard Crossman described him: “a Czech Jew with a perfect knowledge of Russian, who has an infamous reputation in the publishing world.” The House of Commons didn’t know what to make of him either, as he became a byword for bombastic garrulity. Completely ignoring parliamentary convention about the length and frequency of speeches, he held forth more than two hundred times in ten months. He was made chairman of the Commons catering committee partly to shut him up, and he soon wrote off the debts of loss-making bars and dining rooms through what was effectively a fire sale, disposing of the cellar of fine wines for far beneath their value, plenty of them ending up at Headington Hill Hall.

Few at Westminster were sorry to see Maxwell lose his seat in 1970, when he returned to his lurid business career. Before floating Pergamon on the stock exchange in 1964 he had created tax-free trusts in Liechtenstein to make his dealings as opaque as possible, but when in 1969 an American firm bid to take over the company, it withdrew its offer after discovering that Maxwell had inflated sales and profit figures. By 1971 inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry had scrutinized Maxwell’s affairs and published a report describing him as “not…a person who can be relied on to exercise proper stewardship of a publicly quoted company.”

It might seem extraordinary that he could have continued in business at all after that. But Maxwell wasn’t called “the bouncing Czech” for nothing, and soon he bounced back, with his new ambition to become a press magnate. He had already tried and failed to buy the Sun (formerly the Daily Herald, and the voice of the Labour Party) before attempting to buy News of the World, that monument to English salacious prurience. “It would not be a good thing for Mr. Maxwell,” said the editor, Stafford Somerfield, “formerly Jan Ludwig Hoch, to gain control of…a newspaper which I know is as British as roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.” Those distasteful words had an unintended effect, quickening the interest of a young entrepreneur who was as British as roast wallaby. Rupert Murdoch pounced, and his acquisition of News of the World in 1968 began his adventure as a London media mogul. It also began a comical rivalry that lasted more than two decades, in which Maxwell was always outplayed by Murdoch. He thought he was fighting another boxer, the late Harold Evans observed, when “in fact, he’d entered the ring with a ju-jitsu artist who also happened to be carrying a stiletto.” Whatever else one thinks of him, Murdoch was a formidable operator, whereas Maxwell was always a sham.

And yet bouncing on he went, fending off criminal charges all the while, and by 1981 he had acquired control of the British Printing Corporation, until recently the largest printing group in the country, which he renamed the Maxwell Communications Corporation ( MCC ). In 1984 he achieved what seemed a real triumph by buying the Daily Mirror. In its midcentury heyday it had been a great popular newspaper that had won the circulation war as the first true voice of the English working class, and it was still the second-best-selling paper in the country after Murdoch’s Sun. I was in San Francisco for the Democratic Convention when news of the sale reached us, and a group of English scribblers repaired to a bar near Union Square, where Keith Waterhouse, a veteran Mirror columnist, danced a little jig mocking “Cap’n Bob,” before he escaped to the Daily Mail.

What happened next was no laughing matter. Or rather, Maxwell became a bad joke, as he turned the paper into a vehicle for his own glorification, with his face continually appearing in its pages and his fatuous opinions trumpeted. The staff shuddered at his profane and abusive tirades, shouted over the vast coffee cup on his desk that bore the motto “ VERY IMPORTANT PERSON .” He nevertheless found people ready to do his bidding. Roy Greenslade would later write in haughty tones about media matters for The Guardian while clandestinely helping the terrorist Irish Republican Army, as he has recently admitted, but he had earlier served as Maxwell’s editor of the Mirror, and at his behest rigged the competitions in the paper so that the prizes offered would never be won. Before Alastair Campbell became Tony Blair’s spin doctor and helped orchestrate the war of lies that preceded the invasion of Iraq, he also worked for Maxwell. Joe Haines, formerly press officer to Harold Wilson at Downing Street, wrote a ludicrously heroic “official biography” of Maxwell, and Peter Jay, who had been the British ambassador in Washington, became his “chief of staff.”

In 1986 the Thatcher government drastically deregulated the financial markets of the City of London, which was meant to lead to a new golden age of vigorous competition, as was similar deregulation of Wall Street. What ensued was a weird era of reckless casino capitalism, with dazzling innovations like credit default swaps and subprime mortgages, all leading to the crash of 2008. But there was a foretaste of that by way of Maxwell. By the late 1980s his vaunted business empire was in deep trouble, requiring one surreptitious expedient after another to disguise its grave condition. In the hope of cleansing his name Maxwell offered numerous charitable donations—for AIDS research, for starving Ethiopians—but somehow the promised funds rarely arrived.

And yet still the banks—forty-four of them at one point!—lined up to lend him money. They accepted MCC stock as collateral, requiring more stock to be transferred if the share price fell below a certain point, not bothering to wonder whether the price had any real meaning. In fact, while Maxwell was servicing his debts by mortgaging stock (“pig on pork,” as the term of art has it), he was inflating that price by buying MCC stock with money he first borrowed, then stole. As he edged ever closer to the brink he used the oppressive English libel laws to silence critics, notably Private Eye, but when in July 1990 the Financial Times took a hard look and said that shares in his company were essentially worthless, he didn’t dare sue.

Nor was his next (and last) victory all he claimed. By the time Maxwell proudly bought it, the Daily News was near collapse, with circulation plummeting, production controlled by the unions, and distribution controlled by the mob. There was one moment of comic relief when a print union negotiator said that Maxwell seemed “like an English nobleman,” a unique estimation. An even better one came when he insinuated himself into a Washington lunch party where he sat next to President George H.W. Bush and loudly held forth on world affairs. As the bemused Bush left he could be seen mouthing, “Who was that guy?” Funniest of all was when Maxwell ordered Jim Hoge, the publisher of the Daily News, to ring Murdoch in the middle of the Australian night and say that he had bought the paper, at which Murdoch burst into laughter and thanked Maxwell for being so helpful.

Shortly thereafter came his mysterious death. An autopsy showed that he had been alive for hours in the water and may have desperately clung to the boat before his heart gave out, which could suggest an accident, but he had good reason to end it all. And enough was already known about him to make the tributes he received quite grotesque. The recently deposed Thatcher said that Maxwell had shown the world “that one person can move and influence events by using his own God-given talents and abilities,” the Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock called him “one of the few people I have known who deserved to be called irreplaceable,” while Mikhail Gorbachev was “deeply grieved.”

And then the shattering truth emerged. Maxwell’s whole operation was fraudulent: it collapsed with debts of several billion pounds, with the banks that had accepted stock as collateral losing £655 million. Worst of all, the desperate Maxwell had looted £429 million from his companies’ pension funds, including the Mirror’s.

Nothing in this story is so strange as Maxwell’s identity, or what he made of it. He transformed himself into his version of an English—or Scottish—officer and gentleman. About five years before his death, he was dining in Edinburgh with Ian Watson, one of his editors, when the floodlights silhouetting Edinburgh Castle against the night sky came on. “Look, Watty,” Maxwell said, “there’s a sight to warm the hearts of true Scotsmen like you and me!” Watson thought he was joking: “It took a few moments for me to realize Maxwell was being completely serious.”

When he was elected to Parliament in 1964 Maxwell was called by the Jewish Chronicle, which likes to take note of Jewish achievements, including the number of MP s. “I’m not Jewish,” said the sometime yeshiva boy, and put down the telephone. Twenty years later, in the witness box at one of his court cases, he tearfully recalled his mother’s death in Auschwitz, which cynics thought a convenient turn at a time when he wanted sympathy. But his belated acceptance might have been prompted by his personal disintegration, or maybe intimations of mortality.

Did he try to come to terms with the past he had so long concealed? He had begun giving—or at least promising—money to Israeli charities, and when he died no one was more fulsome than Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and future president of Israel, who called Maxwell “not a man but an empire in his power, thought and deeds.” Before the awful truth became known, his body was taken to Jerusalem and given something like a state funeral on the Mount of Olives. A kind of homecoming for the little boy from Solotvino, or a last macabre joke?","['thought', 'mogul', 'stock', 'solotvino', 'maxwell', 'british', 'war', 'world', 'maxwells', 'english', 'later', 'mystery']","Eight months later the yacht was cruising off the Canary Islands with Maxwell aboard until November 5, when he disappeared.
This man of mystery was formed by a bleak early life.
Its Jews often acquired perforce several languages, and as an adult Maxwell could speak English (very distinctively), French, German, Russian, and Czech.
Maxwell much later described one incident when he shouted in German to enemy soldiers in a farmhouse, “Come out with your hands up.
Rupert Murdoch pounced, and his acquisition of News of the World in 1968 began his adventure as a London media mogul."

106,Court seizes Karnataka government’s bus for not paying compensation to accident victim family,"In a first, a lower court in Karnataka has seized a bus belonging to the state-run corporation after it failed to pay Rs 2.82 crore compensation to a road accident victim’s family.

The court had ordered North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) to pay the amount to the family of a software developer who died in a road accident in 2013. The victim, 39-year-old Sanjeev M Patil, was knocked down by a state transport bus while he was crossing the road at Jall tollgate in Bengaluru-Pune Highway around 6 am.

The family went to the court to seek compensation on the grounds that Sanjeev was just 39 years at the time of the accident and was earning Rs 2.10 lakh per month at IBM. The family claimed compensation to the tune of Rs 3.55 crore along with interest.

NWKRTC claimed that the accident occurred on account of Sanjeev’s negligence. However, the court held that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving by the bus driver. The court also observed that an independent witness blamed the driver and the NWKSRTC did not have any evidence to prove that Patil’s negligence led to his death.

The court held that the claimants were entitled to a compensation of Rs 2.15 crore along with an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum to be paid by the NWKSRTC.

The second additional senior civil judge at Davanagere said, “court which went through the documents and salary slips came to a conclusion that Sanjeev Patil monthly income was Rs 1,57,178 and deducting the personal expenses of Sanjeev Patil, it comes around Rs 1,17,884. Taking account of the age, 15 multiplier was adopted and Rs 2,12,19,120 on account loss of dependency and with 8 per cent annual interest from the date of the accident.”

Speaking to indianexpress.com, Jagadeesh VS, divisional controller of NWKRTC’s Haveri division, who is the first respondent in the case, said: ”We have paid Rs 1.52 crore compensation and had taken the case to the high court. However, there was no stay order which made the court officials seize the bus. We are asking the court to give us more time to pay the money as the corporation has also run into huge losses due to Covid-19 situation.

He said that a bus costs about Rs 29 lakh and the bus that was seized is two years old and did not operate much due to the pandemic situation.","['bus', 'paying', 'court', 'compensation', 'rs', 'account', 'road', 'seizes', 'crore', 'karnataka', 'victim', 'governments', 'pay', 'family', 'sanjeev', 'accident']","In a first, a lower court in Karnataka has seized a bus belonging to the state-run corporation after it failed to pay Rs 2.82 crore compensation to a road accident victim’s family.

111,Bengaluru: Web-based GIS system to make commute safer for school-goers,"In a bid to ensure safe commute to school-goers in Bengaluru, a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) tool named Safer Access to Schools (SATS) has been launched in the city.

According to its inventors World Resources Institute (WRI) India, an organisation dealing with environmental and sustainability research, and Underwriters Laboratories, the tool is expected to help policymakers make informed decisions.

According to a recent study, 86 per cent of school children travel less than five kilometres to reach their schools in the city while 58 per cent of them walk to schools.

Sree Kumar Kumaraswamy, head of integrated transport, WRI India, noted that there is a crucial gap in data-based understanding and interventions linked to safety around schools.

“Data is crucial to develop an evidence-based understanding of road safety concerns along each of the schools and can bring together various government stakeholders, NGOs, researchers, and private individuals towards a collaborative action,” he said.

Further, WRI shared insights into road accident fatalities in the city noting that nearly 31 per cent of pedestrian crash fatalities and six per cent of children’s fatalities occurred within 250 metres of the school zone, citing National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data from 2019.

Meanwhile, participating in a discussion titled ‘Enabling Safer Streets for Bengaluru’ at WRI India’s ‘Connect Karo 2021’ event, joint commissioner (traffic) B R Ravikanthe Gowda conceded that space constraints for pedestrians to walk on the road is observed in many areas of the city.

“Some schools in Bengaluru have gates opening directly to the roads. With no specific parking areas available, students get on and off vehicles on the roads, and school managements choose not to bother about them once they are left outside the premises,” Gowda noted.

The top traffic cop stressed the need to prioritise pedestrian safety while designing roads, adding that the Bengaluru traffic police force was also taking measures to impart traffic education to students in schools.

“More pedestrian fatalities in road accidents are getting reported in outer parts of the city than those in CBD (central business district) areas. We need to prioritise the safety of pedestrians while designing roads,” he said.

Meanwhile, Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) commissioner V Manjula said that work is progressing on an ‘Active Mobility Act’, expected to give pedestrians and cyclists the right to complete and connected networks.

“It puts the onus on local bodies to provide good infrastructure and has provisions for ‘mobility wardens’ from the public, who can give suggestions for infrastructural improvements. We need coordination and design policies in place, which will be followed by all stakeholders,” she explained.","['wri', 'roads', 'webbased', 'school', 'schools', 'commute', 'road', 'fatalities', 'gis', 'cent', 'bengaluru', 'schoolgoers', 'system', 'traffic', 'safer', 'safety']","In a bid to ensure safe commute to school-goers in Bengaluru, a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) tool named Safer Access to Schools (SATS) has been launched in the city.

112,"Karnataka: Mother kills adult daughter to hide affair, father helps in dumping body","Karnataka police have arrested three persons for the murder of a 28-year-old woman in Chikkaballapura district. Among those arrested were the murder victim’s parents and uncle. While the mother and the uncle allegedly killed the woman, the victim’s father conspired to pass off the murder as suicide, thinking it to be a case of honour killing.

Chikkaballapura district superintendent of police Mithun Kumar GK said, “Parveena Banu alias Shilpa, a resident of Musalmanarahalli, was murdered earlier this month. Her parents, Gulzar Banu (45) and Fayaz (50), and uncle, Pyaarejan (60), have been arrested in connection to her death. Fayaz is speech impaired and Parveena was his eldest daughter.”

Chikkaballapura district police said the incident took place on September 4.

Cops said that Parveena Banu was murdered after she came to know about her mother’s extra-marital relationship with her uncle. Cops said that Parveena Banu was murdered after she came to know about her mother’s extra-marital relationship with her uncle.

Police sources said Parveena was married to a man from the same community around 10 years ago, but she separated from him a day after their marriage. She then married her boyfriend, Shivappa, who was a resident of Manivala village, and changed her name to Shilpa. But Shivappa was an alcoholic and died owing to poor health. Parveena later started living with another man but he, too, died in a road accident.

Cops said that Parveena was murdered after she came to know about her mother’s extra-marital relationship with her uncle. To hide their affair, Pyaarejan strangled her with a jacket.

After committing the murder, Pyaarejan told Fayaz that they killed Parveena for she had married a man from another religion. Parveena’s father, Fayaz, who was not aware of his wife’s affair with Pyaarejan, helped in transporting the body and dumping it in a dry well in Vatadahosahalli.

On September 5, Gauribidanur rural police retrieved Parveena’s body from the well and an autopsy was conducted on it. Police initially assumed that Parveena might have died by suicide but the post-mortem report suggested that she was strangled to death.

Police, finally, cracked the case after checking the call detail record of Parveena’s mobile phone. Cops found that Parveena had last spoken to her mother and uncle. Upon questioning, both the culprits confessed to their crime. Parveena’s father was arrested for his role in hiding the murder.

Sources said that Fayaz did not know that Parveena was killed to hide the truth of his wife’s affair and now regrets to have helped in covering up the murder.","['helps', 'kills', 'mother', 'uncle', 'murdered', 'affair', 'dumping', 'murder', 'parveenas', 'fayaz', 'parveena', 'hide', 'father', 'daughter', 'arrested', 'banu', 'body', 'karnataka', 'know', 'pyaarejan']","Chikkaballapura district superintendent of police Mithun Kumar GK said, “Parveena Banu alias Shilpa, a resident of Musalmanarahalli, was murdered earlier this month.

Constable Papita has undergone at least seven surgeries, since, and more are underway. She says, “My left leg was completely motionless. But now there is sensation in my left leg. Though both my legs were severely wounded, the left leg received maximum injuries. I am grateful to my senior officers and the police department, for bearing the expenses of my treatment.” After an hour long rescue operation, uncertainty still loomed over her fate, as she was pulled out from the remains of the front body of the truck. She continues to be admitted at PGI.

Constable Deepak, who was posted near Sector 36 Beat Box was knocked down by a speedy car. He received critical head injuries. He, too, was rushed to PGI and underwent a head surgery. “Doctors have successfully removed a big blood clot from the head but Deepak is still under observation. His behavior is unusual. Sometimes he starts shouting about his naka duties. Doctors told us that he will be absolutely fine within a couple of days,” said a close relative of Deepak. He has been admitted in the Neuro-surgical ward.

“Harsh is said to be stable but doctors told us that it will at least take a year for Harsh to fully recover from his jaw and bone injuries. Immediately after the incident, Harsh was rushed to GMCH-32. Today, we took him to PGI for his jaw surgery. Harsh’s treatment has cost around Rs 50,000 so far. The police department is cooperating with us. They have given around Rs 15,000 for the treatment. The senior officers are cooperating”, said Deepak Kumar, Harsh’s elder brother.

DSP Jaswinder Singh of Children Traffic Park (CTP), Sector 23, said, “These incidents, especially on the traffic nakas, are an alarming call. We have been advising the police personnel in every briefing to stop the vehicles and adopt all precautions.”","['20', 'sector', 'near', 'leg', 'papita', 'duty', 'road', 'cops', 'accidents', 'head', 'injured', 'deepak', 'treatment', 'traffic', 'harsh', 'vehicles', 'days', 'severely']","While Papita with met the tragic road accident on September 6, constable Deepak was injured near the Police Beat Box in Sector 36 on September 23.

114,Madras HC quashes order increasing speed limit to 120 kmph on highways,"The Madras High Court has set aside a notification of the central government, fixing 120 kmph as the speed limit for vehicles plying on highways.

A division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran (since retired) and Justice T V Thamilselvi, which quashed the notification dated April 6, 2018, recently, also directed the Centre and the State to issue fresh notifications with decreased speed limit.

Originally, while passing interim orders on an appeal on March 3 this year, the bench, the other member being Justice Abdul Quddhose, increased the compensation amount from Rs 18.43 lakh to Rs 1.50 crore to the appellant — a dentist, who had suffered 90 per cent disability due to a road accident occurred in April 2013 in Kancheepuram in Tamil Nadu.

The bench had also raised a set of 12 queries, the first of which was for a direction to the central government to reconsider its 2018 notification, increasing the speed limit to 120 kmph. The matter was posted in August for filing compliance report.

In its report, the Centre justified its action in increasing the speed limit. It said that keeping in view the better engine technology and improved road infrastructure, an expert committee was constituted to review the speed limits of motor vehicles and as per its recommendations, the maximum speeds for vehicles on different roads had been revised by the Ministry in the April 6 2018 notification.

However, the present bench observed that though there was a better engine technology and improved road infrastructure, there was no improvement in compliance of the road safety rules by the motorists.

From the report released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the number of deaths taking place on roads would prove that more accidents were occurring due to over speeding.

When over speeding was a major cause for road accidents, it is not known as to how the improvement in road infrastructure and engine technology would reduce accidents. In fact, better engine technology would always be a reason for uncontrolled speed and thereby, cause more accidents, the bench said.

“Having known that over speeding is the main cause for road accidents, taking away the precious lives of people and causing damage to properties, the decision taken by the central government, as reflected in the notification dated April 6, 2018 is liable to be quashed.” the bench said and accordingly quashed it.

It also said that the State and the central governments should reduce the speed limit as per August 5, 2014 notification and prescribed a set of speed limits for different types of vehicles.

“Though the matter arises under the Motor Vehicles Act, taking note of a dentist sustaining spinal cord injury and that she is unable to do any work on her own and that she has to depend on others throughout her life, this court invoking Article 226 of the Constitution, suo motu, in public interest, passed this judgment,” the bench added.","['order', '120', 'madras', 'kmph', 'speed', 'technology', 'road', 'accidents', 'increasing', 'quashes', 'hc', 'engine', 'limit', 'notification', 'vehicles', 'central', 'bench', 'highways']","The Madras High Court has set aside a notification of the central government, fixing 120 kmph as the speed limit for vehicles plying on highways.

115,Making streets safe for all: Delhi govt launches six-month online campaign on road safety,"In an attempt to reduce the number of deaths on the streets, the Transport Department has launched a social media campaign, #SadakSurakshitDilliSurakshit. It is aimed at generating online conversations and awareness on four risk factors – speeding, drunk driving, wearing helmets and seatbelts.

A collaboration between the Delhi government and the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, the campaign was launched by Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot at the Road Safety Summit on Friday morning. Over the next six months, @delhiroadsafety will raise awareness on Facebook and Twitter.

“The roads belong to pedestrians as much as they belong to people in vehicles. Through our campaign, we hope to increase awareness about evidence-based best practices in road safety and ensure Delhi roads are safer for all road users. Through the Delhi government’s partnership with the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, we aim to reduce these deaths on the streets of Delhi and hope to build an ecosystem where we do not tolerate any loss of life on our streets,” said Gahlot.

A number of important conversations revolving around road safety were taken up at the summit, with officials and experts sharing the stage.

They said that last year, 1,196 persons were killed while 3,662 persons were left injured in road crashes in the city. They spoke about how deaths and injuries are preventable by means of safer street designs, changes in behaviour supported by strategic communication and enforcement of traffic laws and use of high-quality data for strengthening road safety policies.

A Road Safety Action Plan was presented by Deepak Kumar IAS, Special Commissioner, Road Safety, Transport Department. In his presentation, he spoke about how there has been a 42 per cent decline in accidents over the last decade. Their vision for 2030 is to prevent 50 per cent road traffic deaths and injuries. This can be done by structural intervention, engaging stakeholders, technological intervention, road safety partnerships and regulatory approach.

Structural intervention would include identifying blackspots, creating safe school zones, pedestrian-friendly streetscaping and lane disciplining. At present, 20 blackspots have been identified in the city. He elaborated that implementing an Integrated Road Accident Database (an application to record and manage crash data) would help. Further, he said that Delhi has been treating driving as a life skill and as a first of its kind in the world, automated driving tracks are being set up in educational institutes.

A panel discussion on how Delhi can prevent 50 per cent fatal crashes was held. Experts also discussed the need to create more safe school zones as a number of government school students in the city walk to school and they perceive speeding as a threat. A pilot project has been taken up around a government school in Vasant Kunj and more such projects will be taken up soon.

Another panel discussion regarding the role of citizen groups in supporting the government’s efforts to prevent crashes was discussed. Officials also stressed on the redevelopment of 540 km stretch of roads, which will make a huge part of the city more pedestrian-friendly.","['city', 'roads', 'launches', 'school', 'streets', 'govt', 'transport', 'road', 'taken', 'safe', 'sixmonth', 'online', 'making', 'deaths', 'delhi', 'safety']","A collaboration between the Delhi government and the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, the campaign was launched by Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot at the Road Safety Summit on Friday morning.

116,Maximum road deaths in Bengaluru are reported on Sundays,"Despite weekend lockdowns owing to the Covid-19 pandemic being in force for the greater part of last year, Bengaluru city reported a higher number of deaths and accidents on Sundays.

Like the rest of the country, the city was under lockdown from the last week of March to the first week of June in 2020. Thereafter, the state government enforced weekend lockdowns for a few more months.

In 2020, Bengaluru city reported 657 deaths due to road accidents, of which 109 fatal accidents were reported on Sundays alone. While the number of deaths due to road accidents has come down compared to 2019 (832 deaths) and 2018 (870 deaths), officials attribute the development to the Covid-19 lockdown and associated curbs. Even in previous years, Sundays reported more road accidents compared to other days of the week. While Saturdays recorded fewer fatalities.

Speaking to the IndianExpress.com, joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda said, “Many people who come to Bengaluru during weekends are in a hurry to return to their places on Sundays, leading to a higher number of road accidents. Notably, most mishaps reported on Sundays result from speeding.”

Asked whether lockdown reduced the number of road accidents, Gowda said: “It might have been a factor but the enforcement of laws has played a vital role in reducing the numbers.”

Nightmare for pedestrians

In 2020, 164 pedestrians died in the city due to road accidents, but what continues to be a major concern is that many of the victims lost their lives despite adhering to traffic rules. At least 82 persons died even when they were standing in areas designated for pedestrians. Nearly 332 two-wheeler riders also died in road mishaps.

The data revealed that 189 persons in the 21-30 age group died in road accidents in 2020. Whereas 101 persons aged between 41-50 and 73 persons between 51-60 years lost their lives. Fifty-five persons in the age group of 11-20 also perished in road accidents.

Of the 655 persons accused in road accidents, 438 were in the 21-40 age group. These included 273 self-accidents. Only 17 persons above 61 years were accused of road accidents.

The data also revealed that 51 per cent of accident victims in 2020 died even before they could be taken to a hospital. While 162 persons died on the spot, another 177 persons died on their way to a hospital. Sadly, 308 persons succumbed to their injuries in hospital. The traffic police in its report said that passers-by often failed to respond adequately during the golden hour (the first hour after the accident) and in several instances were seen taking videos and photos of the accident sites and the victims.

117,"Teenager run over in Alwar, family alleges involvement of cow vigilantes","A 16-year-old boy in Rajasthan’s Alwar district was allegedly run over by self-styled cow vigilantes on Sunday morning, his family members have alleged.

The police have said that the boy, identified as Sabir Khan, a resident of Sare Kalan village in Tijara tehsil of Alwar district, died in a vehicle collision after being caught in the middle of a chase between alleged cow smugglers and people chasing them. The teenager’s family members, however, accused the police of trying to suppress the matter.

According to the FIR registered in the matter, the incident took place at around 5:45 am on Sunday morning near Nehar Khedi Road in Alwar district.

Sabir’s family members have stated in the FIR that the teen, along with his friends, would go running every morning and around 4-5 days ago, they had an argument with one Anil over the latter’s reckless driving.

“On that day, Anil had threatened my nephew and his companions that ‘after today if I see you running on this road, then I will run you down with this car and you won’t be do anything to me because I have relationships with Gauraksha Dal and Bajrangbal (sic)’,” says the FIR lodged by Sabir’s uncle after the incident.

The FIR says that after running over Sabir with their car on Sunday morning, the accused also reminded his friends of his prior threat.

Sabir’s friend Mohammed Alim, 20, who was present at the time of the incident, said: “Each day, several of our friends would go for running on that road. Some time back, we had an argument with Anil, a resident of a nearby village, when we asked him not to overspeed since we run on that road. Anil had threatened us at that time. He works with the Bajrang Dal. On Sunday morning, after running over Sabir, he slowed down the car and told me, I have run over your brother, now you know me,” said 20-year-old Mohammed Alim, who was present at the time of the incident.

He claimed that after Anil hit Sabir with his car, another car which was also being driven by his associates drove over the boy.

Imran Khan, a cousin brother of Sabir, said: “Sabir was studying in class 11 and wanted to join the Army. Each day, along with his friends he would go on a run and exercise early in the morning. Earlier as well, people from nearby village Bhogipur who are associated with the gau raksha dal and Bajrang Dal had threatened the kids. On Sunday, they deliberately ran Sabir over with their vehicles despite the fact that he was standing at the side of the road. These people have created a terror here in the name of cow protection.”

On the basis of the complaint submitted by the family of Sabir, the police have registered an FIR at the Chupanki police station under sections 302 (murder), 143 (unlawful assembly) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), naming seven accused — Anil, Mintu, Himansu, Pushkar, Soun, Rahul and Abu, all residents of Haryana.

“Preliminary investigation suggests that a vehicle in which cows were being transported was passing the area and it hit Sabir. The people in that vehicle were cow smugglers. There was another vehicle driven by locals which was following the cow smugglers to catch them. This vehicle too hit Sabir. An FIR has also been registered at the Tauru Sadar police station in Nuh district of Haryana against the cow smugglers and 15 cows were found in their vehicle. Sabir was hit by two vehicles — one being driven by the cow smugglers, other belonging to those chasing the smugglers,” said Hari Ram Kumawat, deputy superintendent of police, Bhiwadi police circle.

He added that so far the police have arrested three people Sonu, Narendra and Harkesh in the matter on the basis of police investigation.

Family members of Sabir, including his cousin Imran and brother-in-law Shahrukh, accused the police of trying to suppress the matter.

“The police want to completely change the direction of the case and suppress the issue. There is no role of any vehicle transporting cows. The accused threatened the kids before and then killed Sabir,” said Imran.

Alim, who was on the spot at the time of the incident, said that Sabir was hit by cars being driven by the accused and denied that he was hit by a vehicle transporting cows.

The police denied the allegations of police inaction.

“The family members have said in the FIR that the accused had threatened them before. But in preliminary investigation we haven’t found anything to corroborate this. It appears to be a case of road accident but still, we are carrying out the investigation and more will be clear after the probe. An FIR has been registered in Haryana related to cow smuggling and we have registered an FIR regarding the death of the kid. It is wrong to say that police are trying to suppress the matter,” said Bhiwadi SP Ram Moorty Joshi.

He added that in preliminary investigation association of the accused with any organization hasn’t been found and further probe is being conducted.","['smugglers', 'anil', 'vigilantes', 'accused', 'sabir', 'vehicle', 'road', 'morning', 'teenager', 'alwar', 'fir', 'cow', 'involvement', 'alleges', 'run', 'hit', 'family']","A 16-year-old boy in Rajasthan’s Alwar district was allegedly run over by self-styled cow vigilantes on Sunday morning, his family members have alleged.

118,Bewilderment by Richard Powers review – stars in their eyes,"We might think of Richard Powers as one of contemporary fiction’s big-game hunters, were that not a woefully inappropriate tag for a novelist whose recent work is animated by a truly non-Hemingwayan philosophical orientation: deep ecology. The Overstory, a novel of the highest ambition and ideational scope for which Powers was awarded a Pulitzer prize, explored territory usually ceded to writers of science fiction: the frontier relationship between the human and the nonhuman (specifically, our planet’s trees, given dramatic life as intelligent and interconnected species).

Bewilderment, Powers’s more immediate new novel, is narrated in the first-person and is half the length of The Overstory’s wilderness stretch. Theo Byrne is a grieving widower and astrobiologist whose work involves building simulated worlds to help determine whether exoplanets beyond our solar system can support life. He does his floundering best to raise his son, Robin: “my sad, singular, newly turning nine-year-old, in trouble with this world”. Theo’s wife, Alyssa, died in a road accident when Robin was seven, and Bewilderment is among other things a triangular family romance.

Bewilderment channels both the cosmic sublime and that of the vast American outdoors

As father and son process their tragedy, the human species accelerates towards ecocide and self-ruination. The novel’s title is perfect: himself a cosmic orphan awed by astral immensities, Theo feels out of his depth as a parent (“I could no more raise a child than I could speak Swahili”), while recognising that his possibly autistic, bipolar or attention-deficit son is a rare and luminous being. A pocket moral absolute, Robin is incapable of knowing that countless species face extinction without devoting himself to resisting this death-drift. The tenderness and delicacy with which the father-son relationship is depicted repeatedly brought to my mind Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, though it is a pre-apocalyptic planet on which Theo and Robin struggle to find fortitude and hope. (Interestingly, Powers, who is in his 60s, is not a father.)

Among the novel’s many virtues is the mood it radiates of sheer cosmic awe. Robin worries himself into fits of agitation by asking the question posed in the Fermi paradox: seeing as the universe is incomprehensibly vast, why have we found no sure signs of intelligent life in its abyss? When Olaf Stapledon’s classic sci-fi novel of aeonic scope Star Maker is mentioned (“the Bible of my youth”), it is not unexpected. Richard Powers is coming to seem a gift to those of us who admire Stapledon’s genre but regret its indifference to human complexities. Impressively precise in its scientific conjectures, Bewilderment is no less rich or wise in its emotionality. Moreover, science fiction is not just a looming generic presence, but part of the novel’s narrative mechanism. In periodic, myth-like passages, Theo takes his son on inner voyages to fantastical alien worlds based on the deep space atmospheric models he creates at work.

Bewilderment channels both the cosmic sublime and that of the vast American outdoors, resting confidently in a lineage with Thoreau and Whitman, Dillard and Kerouac. It’s also a ghostly and affecting love story. Given the choice between putting his difficult son on meds to appease his school authorities and submitting him to experimental neuroscientific research involving emotional states transferred between human subjects, a disquieted Theo watches Alyssa’s resurrected personality merge with Robin’s. Spectral echoes of Solaris haunt these uncanny passages.

We are into the terrain here of myth, metaphysics and religion. Sorrowing awe is Bewilderment’s primary tone, and its many remarkable scenes are controlled with high novelistic intelligence. Robin is as compelling a fictional creation as I’ve encountered in some time – fierce, lovable and otherworldly. In dreaming him up, Powers was clearly working out a bold fictive question: what must it be like to father a Greta Thunberg? The penny dropped for me when “the world’s most famous 14-year-old” makes a cameo: Inga Alder, identical to Thunberg in all but name. A mesmerised Robin falls in love with her over TV and YouTube: “She’s like me, Dad.”

119,The Making of Incarnation by Tom McCarthy review – all work and no play,"Show caption Tom McCarthy: ‘boundary-pushing’.

After consecutive Booker shortlistings, Tom McCarthy’s reputation as a boundary-pushing novelist seems set. But, perhaps more than anything he’s written, this latest work tempts the question: what exactly does a novel have to offer the reader in order to be classified as such?

Structurally, it’s hard to quibble: The Making of Incarnation is multi-stranded in a tradition that goes back to Dickens. Monica Dean, a young lawyer, is at the LSE, researching the early history of time-and-motion studies – an anonymous client is interested in whether movements can be copyrighted. Mark Phocan is also at work: Pantarey is a motion-capture specialist company on the outskirts of Oxford, today enticing a couple to perform enthusiastic sex while plastered in digital markers. And Ben Briar has a new job as scientific adviser on the sci-fi blockbuster Incarnation.

Dean, like everyone else in the book, is only shown doing what she’s employed to do

From there, these strands plough forwards. Dean is sent to Indiana to the archives of Lillian Gilbreth – in the 1930s, she was one of the early pioneers of workplace engineering. In this retelling, she has catalogued her observations in 3D models, illustrating workers’ movements in miniaturised arcs, each reconstructed in a thousand numbered shoeboxes.

Meanwhile, Phocan is sent to Soho to start work on Incarnation – its invented far-galactic world may be a mumbo-jumbo of Athenian-cum-medieval vocabulary and swordplay, but his CGI must ensure that the light from the nearby nebula falls with Hawkingesque precision throughout the spaceship, most especially on the gravity-free copulation scene. There’s barely a page without something like “the accumulated data being fed into the gait lab’s server, amalgamated with cached readings from his previous two sessions and fed forward to the online cataloguing systems of CMAC and ESMAC...” At first, these incomprehensible paragraphs do generate a cutting-edge atmosphere, but they very soon merge into so much IT wallpaper.

Yet far from needing all this factuality, fiction thrives on unknowns – the actual one that drives the plot, and the psychological one, which will give it resonance beyond a mere story. So the upfront mystery kicks in when Dean unearths Gilbreth’s letter to a physicist in then-Soviet Lithuania: apparently, Box 808 “changes everything”, and may in fact encapsulate the “perfect movement”. Result! But Box 808 is missing from the shelves. And when she pushes, Dean’s library access is revoked; soon after, the client also terminates the contract.

McCarthy tells us nothing about the rest of Dean’s life, creates no narrative that might show us how this episode enlarges or diminishes her. The modern novel thrives on moments when an individual behaves out of character but Dean, like everyone else in the book, is only shown doing what she’s employed to do. So what, novelistically speaking, is in it for the reader?

Meanwhile, Phocan spends 23 pages watching a bobsleigh team make use of a digitised wind tunnel. Job done. He travels to a disused sardine factory in Norway to motion-capture an acrobatic team for Incarnation. Job done. And finally, he is sent to Riga to prise Box 808 from the aged Lithuanian physicist. Job not done, because the only tangible result is a less-profound-than-James-Bond coupling with the physicist’s granddaughter, followed by her grandfather’s suicide. Again, Phocan remains unchanged by these events.

But a novel must surely enable us to invest in the central characters’ aspirations or failings or loves and losses. In Remainder, McCarthy’s unforgettable breakthrough novel, the protagonist may be gripped by a Paul Austerish need to painstakingly restage a road accident but his obsession becomes the human enigma that resonates far beyond the mechanics. In this latest book, having lured us with work lives packed with IP, IT and CGI, he offers no enigma, no insight. We are left with what the characters are employed to do, nine to five, and little more. It’s minutely described and probably realistic, but is that a novel?

Using notes left by the founding father of “tartan noir” William McIlvanney (1936-2015), bestselling Scottish novelist Ian Rankin has completed a prequel to the author’s magnificent trilogy featuring police officer Jack Laidlaw. Set in Glasgow in 1972, The Dark Remains (Canongate, £20) is not so much an origin story – the bookish, thoughtful and often acerbic loner, blueprint for Inspector Rebus and many others, seems fully formed and entirely recognisable – as a homage. When lawyer Bobby Carter, right-hand man to gang boss Cam Colvin, is stabbed to death, the police are concerned that this may be the opening salvo in a turf war between the city’s criminal factions. Although a lowly DC, Laidlaw ignores the orders of his blundering superior and strikes out with his own investigation. Ever-changing loyalties and betrayals abound – not least Laidlaw’s selfish neglect of his wife and children – and although the denouement may be predictable, and Rankin’s prose might not quite match McIlvanney’s inimitable style, The Dark Remains is an immersive and satisfyingly pitch-black read.

Set in Sydney, the latest book from the bestselling Australian author Liane Moriarty, Apples Never Fall (Michael Joseph, £20), is an engrossing mashup of family drama and psychological suspense that offers a mystery – the disappearance of 69-year-old Joy Delaney on Valentine’s Day 2020 – then trawls back through the past half century to unravel it. The Delaneys are a tennis family: Stan and Joy met as champions and toured the circuit together before setting up an academy. Although their four children are good players and spent their formative years practising relentlessly, none had the precise combination of physical and psychological qualities that make a champion – unlike Stan’s star pupil, who seemed set to give the pair vicarious glory until he inexplicably jumped ship to another coach. Now retired, Stan and Joy find themselves rudderless, and when a young woman turns up on their doorstep, distressed, they allow her to move in – much to the dismay of their children, who soon begin to suspect that she is not, as she claims, a victim of domestic violence. This is a complex and satisfying tale of the sacrifices we make, the way we betray one another and the slippery nature of memory: perfect holiday reading.

The Rosebud Native American Reservation in South Dakota is the setting for a fascinating debut novel, Winter Counts (Simon & Schuster, £14.99) – the first in a projected series featuring vigilante-for-hire Virgil Wounded Horse – written by David Heska Wanbli Weiden, member of the Sicangu Lakota Nation. Struggling with issues of identity, Virgil acts on behalf of those failed by the unsatisfactory combination of toothless tribal police and a US criminal justice system that all too often declines to prosecute wrongdoers. But the professional becomes personal when his 14-year-old nephew Nathan almost dies from a heroin overdose. With the help of ex-girlfriend Marie Short Bear, Virgil is determined to prevent the influx of the drug into the community, but the cartels are powerful and such authority as he has is extremely limited. Winter Counts is both a solid take on a trope familiar to readers of crime and western genres – the lone man’s quest for justice – and an authentic and humane view of a largely unreported world, ravaged by years of systemic oppression.

For those old enough to remember, the fuzzy outlines of quite a few real people will be visible behind the fictional characters in Robert Peston’s first novel, The Whistleblower (Zaffre, £14.99), set during the run-up to the 1997 general election, when John Major’s Tory government was ousted by a Labour landslide. Central to the action here is Gil Peck who, like his creator, is a political and financial journalist who has OCD – although presumably that’s where the resemblance stops, as Peck is also unscrupulous, obsessive, addicted and careless of the feelings of others. When his estranged sister, a Treasury official, dies in an apparent road accident, he smells a rat, and the resulting investigation uncovers financial shenanigans and undue influence in high places. While it’s not hard to guess who dun what, this enjoyable, intelligent thriller will be catnip for news junkies.

The Wrong Goodbye (MacLehose, £18.99) is the first novel by Japanese bestseller Toshihiko Yahagi to be translated into English, by Alfred Birnbaum. It’s a self-styled homage to Raymond Chandler, set in and around the US naval base at the entrance to Tokyo Bay, featuring hard-drinking police officer Eiji Futamura. His chance meeting with American pilot Billy Lou Bonney kicks off a sequence of events – dead and missing women, black marketeers, former Vietcong moles, triads – that have their roots in the Vietnam war. A clear indication of exactly when the book is set – around 2000, according to my arithmetic – would have removed an unnecessary layer of confusion from this complex, atmospheric thriller.","['set', 'virgil', 'crime', 'roundup', 'joy', 'laidlaw', 'remains', 'rankin', 'recent', 'thrillers', 'winter', 'featuring', 'novel', 'best', 'review', 'ian']","Show caption Prequel time for Jack Laidlaw … Ian Rankin.

STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a civilian police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were traveling, news media said.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist’s partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Muhammad drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle. He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

Vilks’ life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Al-Qaida put a bounty on Vilks’ head. In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden. Last year, a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.","['artist', 'dogs', 'protection', 'media', 'road', 'reportedly', 'sweden', 'threatened', 'vilks', 'muhammad', 'sketch', 'prophet', 'dead', 'swedish', 'accident']","Swedish artist Lars Vilks at his home outside Hoganas in Sweden, Sunday May 16, 2010.

123,Lars Vilks: Swede who lived under police protection after drawing Prophet Muhammad dies in crash,"The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, known for his 2007 drawing of the Prophet Muhammad and the subsequent death threats that followed, died in a car crash on Sunday.

Vilks, who was largely unknown outside of Sweden before his Muhammad drawing, had been living under police protection since 2007.

The drawing of Muhammand with a dog’s body led to a number of plots against him, and Al-Qaida put a bounty on his head.

In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden.

In 2015 he escaped unscathed in Copenhagen from an attack during a debate on Islamism and freedom of expression following the Charlie Hebdo massacre

Last year, a woman from Pennsylvania in the US pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.

Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Police said Vilks, 75, died alongside two of his bodyguards in a road accident.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks insisted he was not a racist and didn’t have a political position, but wanted to probe the limits of what we can and cannot do.

""I think it's very important, if you want to talk about freedom of expression and Islam and Muslims, to have a real position, to have something provocative and transgressive enough to start a debate,” he said.

On the day of the attack on Charlie Hebdo, Lars Vilks confided his sadness to the regional newspaper Helsingborgs Dagblad. ""We cannot give up on freedom of expression. The attack in Paris is unfortunately significant of the times we live in.”

A month later, on 14 February, a young Danish man of Palestinian origin tried to barge into a debate on freedom of expression organised in Copenhagen in response to the Charlie Hebdo massacre.

Vilks, the headliner of the meeting with the French ambassador, escaped unharmed, but a 55-year-old Danish film director was killed.

The assailant then managed to kill a Jewish security guard outside the Copenhagen synagogue, before being shot dead in a stand-off with Danish police.","['attack', 'expression', 'swede', 'protection', 'lived', 'dies', 'muhammad', 'debate', 'vilks', 'charlie', 'lars', 'drawing', 'crash', 'prophet', 'freedom', 'danish', 'copenhagen', 'hebdo']","The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, known for his 2007 drawing of the Prophet Muhammad and the subsequent death threats that followed, died in a car crash on Sunday.

126,Self-Parking Car in 500 Lines of Code,"Self-Parking Car in 500 Lines of Code

28 September, 2021 15 min to read

In this article, we'll train the car to do self-parking using a genetic algorithm.

We'll create the 1st generation of cars with random genomes that will behave something like this:

On the ≈40th generation the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot:

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

Yeah-yeah, the cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so be merciful and give the cars some space to grow :D

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The genetic algorithm for this project is implemented in TypeScript. The full genetic source code will be shown in this article, but you may also find the final code examples in the Evolution Simulator repository.

We're going to use a genetic algorithm for the particular task of evolving cars' genomes. However, this article only touches on the basics of the algorithm and is by no means a complete guide to the genetic algorithm topic.

Having that said, let's deep dive into more details...

The Plan

Step-by-step we're going to break down a high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 bits (finding the optimal car genome).

Here is what we're going to do:

💪🏻 Give the muscles (engine, steering wheel) to the car so that it could move towards the parking spot. 👀 Give the eyes (sensors) to the car so that it could see the obstacles around. 🧠 Give the brain to the car that will control the muscles (movements) based on what the car sees (obstacles via sensors). The brain will be simply a pure function movements = f(sensors) . 🧬 Evolve the brain to do the right moves based on the sensors input. This is where we will apply a genetic algorithm. Generation after generation our brain function movements = f(sensors) will learn how to move the car towards the parking spot.

Giving the muscles to the car

To be able to move, the car would need ""muscles"". Let's give the car two types of muscles:

Engine muscle - allows the car to move ↓ back, ↑ forth, or ◎ stand steel (neutral gear) Steering wheel muscle - allows the car to turn ← left, → right, or ◎ go straight while moving

With these two muscles the car can perform the following movements:

In our case, the muscles are receivers of the signals that come from the brain once every 100ms (milliseconds). Based on the value of the brain's signal the muscles act differently. We'll cover the ""brain"" part below, but for now, let's say that our brain may send only 3 possible signals to each muscle: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

type MuscleSignal = - 1 | 0 | 1 ;

For example, the brain may send the signal with the value of +1 to the engine muscle and it will start moving the car forward. The signal -1 to the engine moves the car backward. At the same time, if the brain will send the signal of -1 to the steering wheel muscle, it will turn the car to the left, etc.

Here is how the brain signal values map to the muscle actions in our case:

Muscle Signal = -1 Signal = 0 Signal = +1 Engine ↓ Backward ◎ Neutral ↑ Forward Steering wheel ← Left ◎ Straight → Right

You may use the Evolution Simulator and try to park the car manually to see how the car muscles work. Every time you press one of the WASD keyboard keys (or use a touch-screen joystick) you send these -1 , 0 , or +1 signals to the engine and steering wheel muscles.

Giving the eyes to the car

Before our car will learn how to do self-parking using its muscles, it needs to be able to ""see"" the surroundings. Let's give it the 8 eyes in a form of distance sensors:

Each sensor can detect the obstacle in a distance range of 0-4m (meters).

(meters). Each sensor reports the latest information about the obstacles it ""sees"" to the car's ""brain"" every 100ms .

. Whenever the sensor doesn't see any obstacles it reports the value of 0 . On the contrary, if the value of the sensor is small but not zero (i.e. 0.01m ) it would mean that the obstacle is close.

You may use the Evolution Simulator and see how the color of each sensor changes based on how close the obstacle is.

type Sensors = number [ ] ;

Giving the brain to the car

At this moment, our car can ""see"" and ""move"", but there is no ""coordinator"", that would transform the signals from the ""eyes"" to the proper movements of the ""muscles"". We need to give the car a ""brain"".

Brain input

As an input from the sensors, every 100ms the brain will be getting 8 float numbers, each one in range of [0...4] . For example, the input might look like this:

const sensors : Sensors = [ s0 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 , s7 ] ;

Brain output

Every 100ms the brain should produce two integers as an output:

One number as a signal for the engine: engineSignal One number as a signal for the steering wheel: wheelSignal

Each number should be of the type MuscleSignal and might take one of three values: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

Brain formulas/functions

Keeping in mind the brain's input and output mentioned above we may say that the brain is just a function:

const { engineSignal , wheelSignal } = brainToMuscleSignal ( brainFunction ( sensors ) ) ;

Where brainToMuscleSignal() is a function that converts raw brain signals (any float number) to muscle signals (to -1 , 0 , or +1 number) so that muscles could understand it. We'll implement this converter function below.

The main question now is what kind of a function the brainFunction() is.

To make the car smarter and its movements to be more sophisticated we could go with a Multilayer Perceptron. The name is a bit scary but this is a simple Neural Network with a basic architecture (think of it as a big formula with many parameters/coefficients).

I've covered Multilayer Perceptrons with a bit more details in my homemade-machine-learning, machine-learning-experiments, and nano-neuron projects. You may even challenge that simple network to recognize your written digits.

However, to avoid the introduction of a whole new concept of Neural Networks, we'll go with a much simpler approach and we'll use two Linear Polynomials with multiple variables (to be more precise, each polynomial will have exactly 8 variables, since we have 8 sensors) which will look something like this:

engineSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( e0 * s0 ) + ( e1 * s1 ) + ... + ( e7 * s7 ) + e8 ) wheelSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( w0 * s0 ) + ( w1 * s1 ) + ... + ( w7 * s7 ) + w8 )

Where:

[s0, s1, ..., s7] - the 8 variables, which are the 8 sensor values. These are dynamic.

- the variables, which are the sensor values. These are dynamic. [e0, e1, ..., e8] - the 9 coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static.

- the coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static. [w0, w1, ..., w8] - the 9 coefficients for the steering wheel polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static

The cost of using the simpler function for the brain will be that the car won't be able to learn some sophisticated moves and also won't be able to generalize well and adapt well to unknown surroundings. But for our particular parking lot and for the sake of demonstrating the work of a genetic algorithm it should still be enough.

We may implement the generic polynomial function in the following way:

type Coefficients = number [ ] ; const linearPolynomial = ( coefficients : Coefficients , variables : number [ ] ) : number => { if ( coefficients . length !== ( variables . length + 1 ) ) { throw new Error ( 'Incompatible number of polynomial coefficients and variables' ) ; } let result = 0 ; coefficients . forEach ( ( coefficient : number , coefficientIndex : number ) => { if ( coefficientIndex < variables . length ) { result += coefficient * variables [ coefficientIndex ] ; } else { result += coefficient } } ) ; return result ; } ;

The car's brain in this case will consist of two polynomials and will look like this:

const engineSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( engineCoefficients , sensors ) ) ; const wheelSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( wheelCoefficients , sensors ) ) ;

The output of a linearPolynomial() function is a float number. The brainToMuscleSignal() function need to convert the wide range of floats to three particular integers, and it will do it in two steps:

Convert the float of a wide range (i.e. 0.456 or 3673.45 or -280 ) to the float in a range of (0...1) (i.e. 0.05 or 0.86 ) Convert the float in a range of (0...1) to one of three integer values of -1 , 0 , or +1 . For example, the floats that are close to 0 will be converted to -1 , the floats that are close to 0.5 will be converted to 0 , and the floats that are close to 1 will be converted to 1 .

To do the first part of the conversion we need to introduce a Sigmoid Function which implements the following formula:

It converts the wide range of floats (the x axis) to float numbers with a limited range of (0...1) (the y axis). This is exactly what we need.

Here is how the conversion steps would look on the Sigmoid graph.

The implementation of two conversion steps mentioned above would look like this:

const sigmoid = ( x : number ) : number => { return 1 / ( 1 + Math . E ** - x ) ; } ; const sigmoidToMuscleSignal = ( sigmoidValue : number , margin : number = 0.4 ) : MuscleSignal => { if ( sigmoidValue < ( 0.5 - margin ) ) { return - 1 ; } if ( sigmoidValue > ( 0.5 + margin ) ) { return 1 ; } return 0 ; } ; const brainToMuscleSignal = ( rawBrainSignal : number ) : MuscleSignal => { const normalizedBrainSignal = sigmoid ( rawBrainSignal ) ; return sigmoidToMuscleSignal ( normalizedBrainSignal ) ; }

Car's genome (DNA)

☝🏻 The main conclusion from the ""Eyes"", ""Muscles"" and ""Brain"" sections above should be this: the coefficients [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] defines the behavior of the car. These 18 numbers together form the unique car's Genome (or car's DNA).

Car genome in a decimal form

Let's join the [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] brain coefficients together to form a car's genome in a decimal form:

const carGenomeBase10 = [ e0 , e1 , ... , e8 , w0 , w1 , ... , w8 ] ;

Car genome in a binary form

Let's move one step deeper (to the level of the genes) and convert the decimal numbers of the car's genome to the binary format (to the plain 1 s and 0 s).

I've described in the detail the process of converting the floating-point numbers to binary numbers in the Binary representation of the floating-point numbers article. You might want to check it out if the code in this section is not clear.

Here is a quick example of how the floating-point number may be converted to the 16 bits binary number (again, feel free to read this first if the example is confusing):

In our case, to reduce the genome length, we will convert each floating coefficient to the non-standard 10 bits binary number ( 1 sign bit, 4 exponent bits, 5 fraction bits).

We have 18 coefficients in total, every coefficient will be converted to 10 bits number. It means that the car's genome will be an array of 0 s and 1 s with a length of 18 * 10 = 180 bits .

For example, for the genome in a decimal format that was mentioned above, its binary representation would look like this:

type Gene = 0 | 1 ; type Genome = Gene [ ] ; const genome : Genome = [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , ] ;

Oh my! The binary genome looks so cryptic. But can you imagine, that these 180 zeroes and ones alone define how the car behaves in the parking lot! It's like you hacked someone's DNA and know what each gene means exactly. Amazing!

By the way, you may see the exact values of genomes and coefficients for the best performing car on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Here is the source code that performs the conversion from binary to decimal format for the floating-point numbers (the brain will need it to decode the genome and to produce the muscle signals based on the genome data):

type Bit = 0 | 1 ; type Bits = Bit [ ] ; type PrecisionConfig = { signBitsCount : number , exponentBitsCount : number , fractionBitsCount : number , totalBitsCount : number , } ; type PrecisionConfigs = { custom : PrecisionConfig , } ; const precisionConfigs : PrecisionConfigs = { custom : { signBitsCount : 1 , exponentBitsCount : 4 , fractionBitsCount : 5 , totalBitsCount : 10 , } , } ; function bitsToFloat ( bits : Bits , precisionConfig : PrecisionConfig ) : number { const { signBitsCount , exponentBitsCount } = precisionConfig ; const sign = ( - 1 ) ** bits [ 0 ] ; const exponentBias = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - 1 ) - 1 ; const exponentBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount , signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const exponentUnbiased = exponentBits . reduce ( ( exponentSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - bitIndex - 1 ) ; return exponentSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; const exponent = exponentUnbiased - exponentBias ; const fractionBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const fraction = fractionBits . reduce ( ( fractionSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** - ( bitIndex + 1 ) ; return fractionSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; return sign * ( 2 ** exponent ) * ( 1 + fraction ) ; } function bitsToFloat10 ( bits : Bits ) : number { return bitsToFloat ( bits , precisionConfigs . custom ) ; }

Brain function working with binary genome

Previously our brain function was working with the decimal form of engineCoefficients and wheelCoefficients polynomial coefficients directly. However, these coefficients are now encoded in the binary form of a genome. Let's add a decodeGenome() function that will extract coefficients from the genome and let's rewrite our brain functions:

const CAR_SENSORS_NUM = 8 ; const BIAS_UNITS = 1 ; const GENES_PER_NUMBER = precisionConfigs . custom . totalBitsCount ; const ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const GENOME_LENGTH = ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ; type DecodedGenome = { engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , } const genomeToNumbers = ( genome : Genome , genesPerNumber : number ) : number [ ] => { if ( genome . length % genesPerNumber !== 0 ) { throw new Error ( 'Wrong number of genes in the numbers genome' ) ; } const numbers : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let numberIndex = 0 ; numberIndex < genome . length ; numberIndex += genesPerNumber ) { const number : number = bitsToFloat10 ( genome . slice ( numberIndex , numberIndex + genesPerNumber ) ) ; numbers . push ( number ) ; } return numbers ; } ; const decodeGenome = ( genome : Genome ) : DecodedGenome => { const engineGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( 0 , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ) ; const wheelsGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ) ; const engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( engineGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; const wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( wheelsGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; return { engineFormulaCoefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients , } ; } ; export const getEngineMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { engineFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ; export const getWheelsMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { wheelsFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ;

Self-driving car problem statement

☝🏻 So, finally, we've got to the point when the high-level problem of making the car to be a self-parking car is broken down to the straightforward optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeros (finding the ""good enough"" car's genome). Sounds simple, doesn't it?

Naive approach

We could approach the problem of finding the ""good enough"" genome in a naive way and try out all possible combinations of genes:

[0, ..., 0, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 0, 1] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 1] , and then... ...

But, let's do some math. With 180 bits and with each bit being equal either to 0 or to 1 we would have 2^180 (or 1.53 * 10^54 ) possible combinations. Let's say we would need to give 15s to each car to see if it will park successfully or not. Let's also say that we may run a simulation for 10 cars at once. Then we would need 15 * (1.53 * 10^54) / 10 = 2.29 * 10^54 [seconds] which is 7.36 * 10^46 [years] . Pretty long waiting time. Just as a side thought, it is only 2.021 * 10^3 [years] that have passed after Christ was born.

Genetic approach

We need a faster algorithm to find the optimal value of the genome. This is where the genetic algorithm comes to the rescue. We might not find the best value of the genome, but there is a chance that we may find the optimal value of it. And, what is, more importantly, we don't need to wait that long. With the Evolution Simulator I was able to find a pretty good genome within 24 [hours] .

Genetic algorithm basics

A genetic algorithms (GA) inspired by the process of natural selection, and are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as crossover, mutation and selection.

The problem of finding the ""good enough"" combination of genes for the car looks like an optimization problem, so there is a good chance that GA will help us here.

We're not going to cover a genetic algorithm in all details, but on a high level here are the basic steps that we will need to do:

CREATE – the very first generation of cars can't come out of nothing, so we will generate a set of random car genomes (set of binary arrays with the length of 180 ) at the very beginning. For example, we may create ~1000 cars. With a bigger population the chances to find the optimal solution (and to find it faster) increase. SELECT - we will need to select the fittest individuums out of the current generation for further mating (see the next step). The fitness of each individuum will be defined based on the fitness function, which in our case, will show how close the car approached the target parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. MATE – simply saying we will allow the selected ""♂ father-cars"" to have ""sex"" with the selected ""♀ mother-cars"" so that their genomes could mix in a ~50/50 proportion and produce ""♂♀ children-cars"" genomes. The idea is that the children cars might get better (or worse) in self-parking, by taking the best (or the worst) bits from their parents. MUTATE - during the mating process some genes may randomly mutate ( 1 s and 0 s in child genome may flip). This may bring a wider variety of children genomes and, thus, a wider variety of children cars behavior. Imagine that the 1st bit was accidentally set to 0 for all ~1000 cars. The only way to try the car with the 1st bit being set to 1 is through the random mutations. At the same time, extensive mutations may ruin healthy genomes. Go to ""Step 2"" unless the number of generations has reached the limit (i.e. 100 generations have passed) or unless the top-performing individuums have reached the expected fitness function value (i.e. the best car has approached the parking spot closer than 1 meter ). Otherwise, quit.

Evolving the car's brain using a Genetic Algorithm

Before launching the genetic algorithm let's go and create the functions for the ""CREATE"", ""SELECT"", ""MATE"" and ""MUTATE"" steps of the algorithm.

Functions for the CREATE step

The createGeneration() function will create an array of random genomes (a.k.a. population or generation) and will accept two parameters:

generationSize - defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation.

- defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation. genomeLength - defines the genome length of each individuum in the cars population. In our case, the length of the genome will be 180 .

There is a 50/50 chance for each gene of a genome to be either 0 or 1 .

type Generation = Genome [ ] ; type GenerationParams = { generationSize : number , genomeLength : number , } ; function createGenome ( length : number ) : Genome { return new Array ( length ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? 0 : 1 ) ) ; } function createGeneration ( params : GenerationParams ) : Generation { const { generationSize , genomeLength } = params ; return new Array ( generationSize ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => createGenome ( genomeLength ) ) ; }

Functions for the MUTATE step

The mutate() function will mutate some genes randomly based on the mutationProbability value.

For example, if the mutationProbability = 0.1 then there is a 10% chance for each genome to be mutated. Let's say if we would have a genome of length 10 that looks like [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] , then after the mutation, there will be a chance that 1 gene will be mutated and we may get a genome that might look like [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] .

type Probability = number ; function mutate ( genome : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability ) : Genome { for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < genome . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { const gene : Gene = genome [ geneIndex ] ; const mutatedGene : Gene = gene === 0 ? 1 : 0 ; genome [ geneIndex ] = Math . random ( ) < mutationProbability ? mutatedGene : gene ; } return genome ; }

Functions for the MATE step

The mate() function will accept the father and the mother genomes and will produce two children. We will imitate the real-world scenario and also do the mutation during the mating.

Each bit of the child genome will be defined based on the values of the correspondent bit of the father's or mother's genomes. There is a 50/50% probability that the child will inherit the bit of the father or the mother. For example, let's say we have genomes of length 4 (for simplicity reasons):

Father's genome: [0, 0, 1, 1] Mother's genome: [0, 1, 0, 1] ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ Possible kid #1: [0, 1, 1, 1] Possible kid #2: [0, 0, 1, 1]

In the example above the mutation were not taken into account.

Here is the function implementation:

function mate ( father : Genome , mother : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability , ) : [ Genome , Genome ] { if ( father . length !== mother . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Cannot mate different species' ) ; } const firstChild : Genome = [ ] ; const secondChild : Genome = [ ] ; for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < father . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { firstChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; secondChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; } return [ mutate ( firstChild , mutationProbability ) , mutate ( secondChild , mutationProbability ) , ] ; }

Functions for the SELECT step

To select the fittest individuums for further mating we need a way to find out the fitness of each genome. To do this we will use a so-called fitness function.

The fitness function is always related to the particular task that we try to solve, and it is not generic. In our case, the fitness function will measure the distance between the car and the parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. We will implement the fitness function a bit later, but for now, let's introduce the interface for it:

type FitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) => number ;

Now, let's say we have fitness values for each individuum in the population. Let's also say that we sorted all individuums by their fitness values so that the first individuums are the strongest ones. How should we select the fathers and the mothers from this array? We need to do the selection in a way, that the higher the fitness value of the individuum, the higher the chances of this individuum being selected for mating. The weightedRandom() function will help us with this.

const weightedRandom = < T > ( items : T [ ] , weights : number [ ] ) : { item : T , index : number } => { if ( items . length !== weights . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Items and weights must be of the same size' ) ; } const cumulativeWeights : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < weights . length ; i += 1 ) { cumulativeWeights [ i ] = weights [ i ] + ( cumulativeWeights [ i - 1 ] || 0 ) ; } const maxCumulativeWeight = cumulativeWeights [ cumulativeWeights . length - 1 ] ; const randomNumber = maxCumulativeWeight * Math . random ( ) ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < items . length ; i += 1 ) { if ( cumulativeWeights [ i ] >= randomNumber ) { return { item : items [ i ] , index : i , } ; } } return { item : items [ items . length - 1 ] , index : items . length - 1 , } ; } ;

The usage of this function is pretty straightforward. Let's say you really like bananas and want to eat them more often than strawberries. Then you may call const fruit = weightedRandom(['banana', 'strawberry'], [9, 1]) , and in ≈9 out of 10 cases the fruit variable will be equal to banana , and only in ≈1 out of 10 times it will be equal to strawberry .

To avoid losing the best individuums (let's call them champions) during the mating process we may also introduce a so-called longLivingChampionsPercentage parameter. For example, if the longLivingChampionsPercentage = 10 , then 10% of the best cars from the previous population will be carried over to the new generation. You may think about it as there are some long-living individuums that can live a long life and see their children and even grandchildren.

Here is the actual implementation of the select() function:

type Percentage = number ; type SelectionOptions = { mutationProbability : Probability , longLivingChampionsPercentage : Percentage , } ; function select ( generation : Generation , fitness : FitnessFunction , options : SelectionOptions , ) { const { mutationProbability , longLivingChampionsPercentage , } = options ; const newGeneration : Generation = [ ] ; const oldGeneration = [ ... generation ] ; oldGeneration . sort ( ( genomeA : Genome , genomeB : Genome ) : number => { const fitnessA = fitness ( genomeA ) ; const fitnessB = fitness ( genomeB ) ; if ( fitnessA < fitnessB ) { return 1 ; } if ( fitnessA > fitnessB ) { return - 1 ; } return 0 ; } ) ; const longLiversCount = Math . floor ( longLivingChampionsPercentage * oldGeneration . length / 100 ) ; if ( longLiversCount ) { oldGeneration . slice ( 0 , longLiversCount ) . forEach ( ( longLivingGenome : Genome ) => { newGeneration . push ( longLivingGenome ) ; } ) ; } const fitnessPerOldGenome : number [ ] = oldGeneration . map ( ( genome : Genome ) => fitness ( genome ) ) ; while ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { let father : Genome | null = null ; let fatherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; let mother : Genome | null = null ; let matherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; while ( ! father || ! mother || fatherGenomeIndex === matherGenomeIndex ) { const { item : randomFather , index : randomFatherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; const { item : randomMother , index : randomMotherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; father = randomFather ; fatherGenomeIndex = randomFatherGenomeIndex ; mother = randomMother ; matherGenomeIndex = randomMotherGenomeIndex ; } const [ firstChild , secondChild ] = mate ( father , mother , mutationProbability ) ; newGeneration . push ( firstChild ) ; if ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { newGeneration . push ( secondChild ) ; } } return newGeneration ; }

Fitness function

The fitness of the car will be defined by the distance from the car to the parking spot. The higher the distance, the lower the fitness.

The final distance we will calculate is an average distance from 4 car wheels to the correspondent 4 corners of the parking spot. This distance we will call the loss which is inversely proportional to the fitness .

Calculating the distance between each wheel and each corner separately (instead of just calculating the distance from the car center to the parking spot center) will make the car preserve the proper orientation relative to the parking spot.

The distance between two points in space will be calculated based on the Pythagorean theorem like this:

type NumVec3 = [ number , number , number ] ; const euclideanDistance = ( from : NumVec3 , to : NumVec3 ) => { const fromX = from [ 0 ] ; const fromZ = from [ 2 ] ; const toX = to [ 0 ] ; const toZ = to [ 2 ] ; return Math . sqrt ( ( fromX - toX ) ** 2 + ( fromZ - toZ ) ** 2 ) ; } ;

The distance (the loss ) between the car and the parking spot will be calculated like this:

type RectanglePoints = { fl : NumVec3 , fr : NumVec3 , bl : NumVec3 , br : NumVec3 , } ; type GeometricParams = { wheelsPosition : RectanglePoints , parkingLotCorners : RectanglePoints , } ; const carLoss = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const { wheelsPosition , parkingLotCorners } = params ; const { fl : flWheel , fr : frWheel , br : brWheel , bl : blWheel , } = wheelsPosition ; const { fl : flCorner , fr : frCorner , br : brCorner , bl : blCorner , } = parkingLotCorners ; const flDistance = euclideanDistance ( flWheel , flCorner ) ; const frDistance = euclideanDistance ( frWheel , frCorner ) ; const brDistance = euclideanDistance ( brWheel , brCorner ) ; const blDistance = euclideanDistance ( blWheel , blCorner ) ; return ( flDistance + frDistance + brDistance + blDistance ) / 4 ; } ;

Since the fitness should be inversely proportional to the loss we'll calculate it like this:

const carFitness = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const loss = carLoss ( params ) ; return 1 / ( loss + 1 ) ; } ;

You may see the fitness and the loss values for a specific genome and for a current car position on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Launching the evolution

Let's put the evolution functions together. We're going to ""create the world"", launch the evolution loop, make the time going, the generation evolving, and the cars learning how to park.

To get the fitness values of each car we need to run a simulation of the cars behavior in a virtual 3D world. The Evolution Simulator does exactly that - it runs the code below in the simulator, which is made with Three.js:

const GENERATION_SIZE = 1000 ; const LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE = 6 ; const MUTATION_PROBABILITY = 0.04 ; const MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM = 40 ; const carFitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) : number => { const genomeKey = genome . join ( '' ) ; return fitnessValues [ genomeKey ] ; } ; let generationIndex = 0 ; let generation : Generation = createGeneration ( { generationSize : GENERATION_SIZE , genomeLength : GENOME_LENGTH , } ) ; while ( generationIndex < MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM ) { generation = select ( generation , carFitnessFunction , { mutationProbability : MUTATION_PROBABILITY , longLivingChampionsPercentage : LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE , } , ) ; generationIndex += 1 ; } const fittestCar = generation [ 0 ] ;

After running the select() function, the generation array is sorted by the fitness values in descending order. Therefore, the fittest car will always be the first car in the array.

The 1st generation of cars with random genomes will behave something like this:

On the ≈40th generation the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot:

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

The cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so you may give the cars some more time to learn.

From generation to generation we may see how the loss values are going down (which means that fitness values are going up). The P50 Avg Loss shows the average loss value (average distance from the cars to the parking spot) of the 50% of fittest cars. The Min Loss shows the loss value of the fittest car in each generation.

You may see that on average the 50% of the fittest cars of the generation are learning to get closer to the parking spot (from 5.5m away from the parking spot to 3.5m in 35 generations). The trend for the Min Loss values is less obvious (from 1m to 0.5m with some noise signals), however from the animations above you may see that cars have learned some basic parking moves.

Conclusion

In this article, we've broken down the high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level task of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeroes (finding the optimal car genome).

Then we've applied the genetic algorithm to find the optimal car genome. It allowed us to get pretty good results in several hours of simulation (instead of many years of running the naive approach).

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The full genetic source code that was shown in this article may also be found in the Evolution Simulator repository. If you are one of those folks who will actually count and check the number of lines to make sure there are less than 500 of them (excluding tests), please feel free to check the code here 🥸.

There are still some unresolved issues with the code and the simulator:

The car's brain is oversimplified and it uses linear equations instead of, let's say, neural networks. It makes the car not adaptable to the new surroundings or to the new parking lot types.

We don't decrease the car's fitness value when the car is hitting the other car. Therefore the car doesn't ""feel"" any guilt in creating the road accident.

The evolution simulator is not stable. It means that the same car genome may produce different fitness values, which makes the evolution less efficient.

The evolution simulator is also very heavy in terms of performance, which slows down the evolution progress since we can't train, let's say, 1000 cars at once.

Also the Evolution Simulator requires the browser tab to be open and active to perform the simulation.

and more...

However, the purpose of this article was to have some fun while learning how the genetic algorithm works and not to build a production-ready self-parking Teslas. So, even with the issues mentioned above, I hope you've had a good time going through the article.","['generation', 'brain', '500', 'lines', 'const', 'length', 'function', 'car', 'genome', 'code', 'cars', 'return', 'number', 'selfparking']","Self-Parking Car in 500 Lines of Code28 September, 2021 15 min to readIn this article, we'll train the car to do self-parking using a genetic algorithm.

127,Swedish artist under police protection dies in road accident,"Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, has died in a traffic accident, police said. He was 75.

Vilks and two plainclothes police bodyguards were killed in a head-on crash with a truck on Sunday afternoon, said Carina Persson, police chief for southern Sweden.

She said the police car veered into the path of the truck and both vehicles burst into flames. The truck driver was flown to a hospital with serious injuries.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before 2007, when he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

There were a number of attempts on his life over the years.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a civilian police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were traveling, news media said.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist's partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Muhammad drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle. He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

Vilks’ life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

132,Sabah health director lodges police report against woman over 'aggressive' behaviour,"KOTA KINABALU: Sabah Health Director Dr Rose Nani Mudin says she filed a police report against a woman several days after a road accident due to her allegedly aggressive behaviour.

Dr Rose Nani said she had called the police to her office on Monday (Oct 4) after the woman, who goes by the name Shima on social media, came to her office building to look for her.

She added that a report was lodged as she feared for her safety and that of her staff.

In a statement, she explained that the accident occurred near the city at about 9.55pm on Sept 27 when she was on the way home from work.

Dr Rose Nani said she followed the necessary procedure, which was to lodge a police report and then let her insurance company follow up.

She said that on Sept 28, the woman came to her office to make several claims from her staff over the accident.

Her staff told Shima that the matter would be handled by the insurance company and advised her to refer to it for further details.

On Monday, Shima reportedly went to the director’s office again to meet her but Dr Rose Nani was in a meeting.

“I was told that she was aggressive and that was why I decided to lodge a police report,"" Dr Rose Nani said.

Shima also took to social media to complain about the way things were handled, saying she only wanted to meet Dr Rose Nani to settle some matters regarding the accident.

Kota Kinabalu acting police chief Supt George Rakman said the matter was a simple traffic case and as in most situations, the parties involved would need to go to a police station to lodge a report.

From there, statements would be taken and the one in the wrong would have to inform their insurance company for repair and claims purposes.

“Everything will be handled by the insurance company. There is no need for the parties involved in the accident to meet,” he said.

He added that police would not be filing criminal charges against anyone as yet.","['health', 'director', 'meet', 'shima', 'office', 'report', 'insurance', 'aggressive', 'woman', 'dr', 'behaviour', 'nani', 'lodges', 'rose', 'company', 'sabah']","KOTA KINABALU: Sabah Health Director Dr Rose Nani Mudin says she filed a police report against a woman several days after a road accident due to her allegedly aggressive behaviour.

133,Construction worker killed after row with friend,"GEORGE TOWN: A 52-year-old construction worker has allegedly been killed by his friend after a heated argument.

George Town OCPD Asst Comm Soffian Santong said police received a distress call at 2.30pm on Friday (Sept 24).

“We were told there was a fatal road accident at Changkat Minden Height, Gelugor.

“Based on the information given, police immediately went to the scene.

“However, investigations at the scene found that there were no elements of a road accident.

“The police team suspected foul play and that a crime had been committed,” he said.

ACP Soffian added that after the North-East District crime investigation team arrived at the scene and did a preliminary examination, they suspected that the victim had been beaten up.

From interviews with witnesses, he said, they gathered that a 42-year-old suspect had fought with the victim.

“The suspect claimed that the victim said rude things to him,"" ACP Soffian said, adding that this resulted in the suspect beating up the victim.

“Further investigations revealed that the victim was initially lying next to his motorcycle and a witness shifted his body to try and resuscitate him, but failed to do so.

“The forensics team did not find any weapons used during the fight.

“However, there were bruises on the victim’s forehead and a small cut near his right eye.

“The victim will be taken to the hospital for a post-mortem to determine the actual cause of death,” he said.

He added that the case is being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder, which carries the death penalty upon conviction.

“We have identified the suspect and investigations are still ongoing.

“We hope that members of the public with information about the incident will come forward to the nearest police station to facilitate investigations.

134,HR Ministry to table proposal to provide free Socso protection for 2 million B40 housewives,"KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): The Human Resources Ministry through the Social Security Organisation (Socso) and Women, Family and Community Development Ministry (KWPKM) will propose to the Cabinet to provide free Socso protection for about two million B40 housewives nationwide.

Minister Datuk Seri M. Saravanan (pic) said following discussions, the ministry saw the need to protect the group who had been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, especially when husbands as the family’s breadwinner, could not go out to work.

""However, this will depend on the government's financial position... in this pandemic situation, if the husband is out of work and the wife has some chronic illness, they have no safety net.

""As a government that cares and prioritises the people’s welfare, we recommend that this move be considered to provide two million B40 housewives with a free safety net protection,"" he said after presenting Socso’s benefits to the widow of the late Vijaya Kumaran T. Veerasamy here today.

Vijaya Kumaran died on May 21 after suffering brain damage following a road accident on April 12, last year.

Prior to this, the deceased's medical treatment, which included an implant surgery amounting to RM23,000, was fully paid by Socso.

Earlier the government had agreed to make contribution payments to some 150,000 women in the B40 group registered under e-Kasih.

Meanwhile, on labour shortage in the plantation sector, Saravanan said, currently the country needed 100,000 workers in the sector but the ministry would continue to give priority to locals to fill the job vacancies.

""Foreign workers will be hired as a last resort,” he said adding that priority would continue to be given to locals, despite pressure from the plantation sector employers and the fact that this could affect national income. - Bernama","['safety', 'sector', 'proposal', 'protection', 'table', 'million', 'b40', 'ministry', 'women', 'saravanan', 'workers', 'socso', 'free', 'housewives', 'provide', 'hr']","KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): The Human Resources Ministry through the Social Security Organisation (Socso) and Women, Family and Community Development Ministry (KWPKM) will propose to the Cabinet to provide free Socso protection for about two million B40 housewives nationwide.

135,"Denying driving licences to senior citizens would be a last resort, says Transport Minister","PETALING JAYA: Senior citizens will be issued driving licences if they are able to operate a vehicle and denying one would be a last resort measure, says Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong (pic).

""Retracting or limiting senior citizens to driving licences should be a last resort once it is proven they are unable to drive,” said the Transport Minister.

He said the issue needed a broader and more holistic view instead of focusing on age alone.

""The suggestion to limit motor vehicle licences (LKM) to senior citizens can also result in them only having to borrow another person's vehicle to bypass the law,"" said Dr Wee in a Facebook video on Saturday (Sept 25).

""Referring to isolated incidents or evaluating an individual based on their age would be discriminatory.

""There are also many drivers aged 70 and above who display better driving proficiency than younger drivers,"" he said.

He added that it was also the responsibility of individuals whose health is affecting their driving ability to hand in their licences to Road Transport Department (JPJ) offices.

Dr Wee also called for all stakeholders to come together and create an effective and inclusive plan for all.

On Friday (Sept 24), Bukit Aman Traffic Investigation and Enforcement Department (JSPT) director Comm Datuk Azisman Alias had proposed that the government limit the issuance of Motor Vehicle Licences to senior citizens.

He said this is because the health condition of senior citizens could contribute to road accidents. He said that senior citizens should also undergo a medical check-up and get approval from a doctor to ascertain that they are fit to drive.

“Elderly people are more likely to suffer from health conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and blurred vision, which can indirectly cause a road accident.

“There was a case where a senior citizen was caught driving on a motorcycle lane. The government needs to look into this issue,” he told a press conference.","['driving', 'health', 'citizens', 'denying', 'senior', 'vehicle', 'wee', 'road', 'sept', 'resort', 'minister', 'transport', 'licences']","PETALING JAYA: Senior citizens will be issued driving licences if they are able to operate a vehicle and denying one would be a last resort measure, says Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong (pic).

Northeast district police chief ACP Soffian Santong said in a statement on Sunday (Sept 26) that the three men, aged 41 to 57, were nabbed in separate raids in Air Itam, Jelutong and Lebuh Pantai from 5.15pm to 8.30pm on Friday.

He said that two of the three men had criminal and drug records while urine tests showed one of them was positive for drugs, adding that all three have been remanded for five days until Sept 30 over the case, which is being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder.

In the 2.30pm incident on Friday, the victim was found dead, allegedly from being assaulted by another man, 42, after a fight due to a misunderstanding.

137,Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin ethics in question as FAA investigates,"The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced Thursday that it would review Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin over safety concerns brought to its attention by company employees.

The review was sparked by a letter composed by former Blue Origin Communications Director Alexandra Abrams and 20 unnamed current and former employees.

The letter issued a stark warning about the company's advertised mission of wanting to enable a better future for mankind by exploiting space. It claims that Bezos' sales pitch for a Utopian future for humanity is based on a corporate present that is toxic to the core.

The FAA — the nation's top air safety regulator — says it ""takes every safety allegation seriously and the agency is reviewing the information.""

A toxic workplace on a dying planet?

Abrams describes several disturbing aspects of the company, mainly centered around the White male dominated inner circle that runs operations. The letter cites sexist behavior and hiring practices, as well as an exploitative labor system in which those close to Bezos stifle dissent and coerce hopelessly overworked or dissatisfied employees into silence through firings and ever more punitive non-disparagement agreements.

Allegations range from systemic sexually inappropriate behavior, to mental and physical duress. The consistent prioritization of ""making progress for Jeff"" over addressing a myriad of safety concerns brought forward by employees is also highlighted. Moreover, the letter alleges that women are mercilessly badgered for raising concerns.

Abrams also claims she was instructed to make it difficult for employees to ask questions at company town hall meetings ostensibly designed as a forum for open discussion. She spoke of a ""dehumanizing"" work atmosphere in which ""troublemakers or agitators"" were singled out and put on lists given to senior managers as part of a broader system of control over workers.

'Be careful with Jeff's money'

Decision making at Blue Origin, the letter claims, is limited to a select inner circle impatient to publicly display progress while ignoring the safety concerns of some engineers. Requests for more staff, she alleges, were regularly rebuffed, with managers and employees told to ""be grateful"" and to ""be careful with Jeff's money.""

Abrams' letter claims that the desire to beat billionaires Elon Musk and Richard Branson into space compromised safety. She continued by comparing the breakneck pace of launches and the safety issues that ensue, to those of NASA's doomed Challenger program, where seven astronauts lost their lives after safety was compromised by a desperation to launch.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The shock On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after takeoff. It was then the most severe accident in NASA's space program. Challenger was the third of what would eventually become five space shuttles. Before it exploded, the shuttle had completed nine flights.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Just before the catastrophe Space Shuttle Challenger takes off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. Spectators are applauding. Only seconds later enthusiasm turns into horror. Numerous family members and colleagues of the astronauts are among the viewers.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The victims These seven astronauts were killed in the accident (from left to right): Aerospace engineer Ellison Onizuka, pilot Mike Smith, elementary school teacher Christa McAuliffe, test pilot and aerospace engineer Dick Scobee, payload specialist Greg Jarvis, physicist Ron McNair and electrical engineer and specialist for telemetry Judith Resnik.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Inspiration for generations McAuliffe was supposed to become the first teacher in space - and an inspiration for many other students and teachers. In subsequent years, many astronauts carried on with the idea of bringing science and technology back from space into the classroom. Here, McAuliffe is talking to Barbara Morgan during astronaut training. Morgan stayed behind as a backup for McAuliffe.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes A defective seal One or more o-ring seals failed after a very cold night with freezing temperatures and then high temperatures during takeoff. Exhaust gas came out at the side of the rocket, rather than through the engine. Here the head of the presidential investigation commission William Rogers is testifying at a Senate committee. His deputy, astronaut Neil Armstrong, is listening.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Grief and consternation Germany grieved for the dead astronauts as well. Only three month before the accident, the two first West German astronauts Reinhard Furrer and Ernst Messerschmid (first and fifth from left) flew with the same space shuttle. They launched the German-built Spacelab D-1, the first big space exploration project of the Federal Republic of Germany.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Starting up again after a long break Two and a half years after the tragedy, NASA resumed shuttle flights. On December 29, 1988, Space Shuttle Discovery took off from Cape Canaveral. Again there were glitches: Parts of a tank's insulation broke off. Nevertheless, Discovery became one of the most successful space shuttles, and the most used one, too - between 1984 and 2011, it took off 39 times.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The second catastrophe 17 years and 87 space shuttle flights after the Challenger tragedy, criticism of the program had nearly died down. Then a second catastrophe happened: Space Shuttle Columbia broke apart during reentry into Earth's atmosphere on February 1, 2003. All seven crew members died. The likely cause was damage a wing had suffered during takeoff, when it was hit by a piece of fuel-tank insulation foam.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Essential for space research Despite the two accidents, NASA's shuttle program can look back on a proud history: 133 flights were concluded successfully. Here, Space Shuttle Atlantis is approaching the International Space Station (ISS). Without the shuttles, it would have been almost impossible to build the ISS. The Russian Soyuz capsule in the foreground is today's standard vehicle for human space travel to the ISS.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes A small shuttle in infinite space In comparison to the ISS, Space Shuttle Endeavour looks almost tiny on this picture. It is one of very few photos ever taken of a docked space shuttle at the station. Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli had the opportunity to take the shot in 2011 from inside a Soyuz space capsule on the way home from the ISS.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Serving science Space shuttle Atlantis is docking on to the ISS for the second to last time in May 2010. Its last flight took place one year later. By then, space shuttles had delivered uncountable telecommunication-, navigation- and research satellites into their orbit, including space telescope Hubble. They retrieved and repaired satellites and even visited the Russian space station Mir.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Riding piggyback for the last flight Space Shuttle Endeavour flies for the last time - mounted on a special Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet. The plane took the shuttle to its retirement home, the California Science Center in Los Angeles. They took a detour to do a final flyby over the Golden Gate Bridge and several cities along the West Coast. Endeavour had seen its last space flight in May 2011, Atlantis' was in July of the same year.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes And the dream goes on The future of human space travel looks somewhat like the past: The newest NASA spaceship will be Orion. Its design recalls the first Apollo spaceships. The European Space Agency (ESA) will deliver important components for Orion. The new spaceship will be bigger than the Soyuz spacecrafts and also travel farther - to the moon or maybe even to Mars one day. Author: Fabian Schmidt



Safety, according to the letter, is an afterthought at Blue Origin, both in regard to production and environment, as well as to vehicle flight systems.

The employees behind the letter pointed out the extremely limited scope of the FAA's mandate to regulate the space industry, arguing that it must be expanded.

The letter, published on storytelling platform lioness.co, a website which helps individuals bring their ordeals to the media, ended with another, much broader question, namely: ""Should we as a society allow ego-driven individuals with endless caches of money and very little accountability to be the ones to shape that future?""","['bezos', 'shuttle', 'safety', 'investigates', 'blue', 'letter', 'took', 'origin', 'ago', 'jeff', 'ethics', 'question', 'space', 'explodes', 'astronauts', 'employees', 'challenger', 'faa']","30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The shock On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after takeoff.

141,"Failed In Theaters, Faces Rejection On OTT","Bollywood Superstar Akshay Kumar‘s Bell Bottom is the first major theatrical release from Bollywood after the Second wave. The movie, however, failed to impress the critics and bring the audience to the theaters. Now, the movie is releasing on OTT.

Bell Bottom will stream on Amazon Prime Video from September 16th. The OTT giant has announced the release date officially. But then, going by the buzz on the social media, audience seems to be not very excited about the film and it may not even excite the OTT audience.

Bollywood filmmakers have been shell-shocked with the response for Bell Bottom and that has sealed any hopes of a recovery in near future. As a result, more and more films are looking at a possible Direct-to-OTT release now. Amazon Prime Video is obviously the beneficiary of such a trend.

So, Bell Bottom has helped Amazon Prime Video in that way even if it fails when it arrives on the Platform.

146,Emma Raducanu joins an illustrious list of teen Slam winners,"Last updated on .From the section Tennis

Emma Raducanu made her tour-level debut in June 2021 at WTA Nottingham

British teenager Emma Raducanu rewrote the history books when she won her maiden Grand Slam title at the US Open.

The 18-year-old new British number one, who has risen to 23 in the world rankings, joins an illustrious list of some of the best-known names in tennis, who hit the big time when they won their first major title while still a teenager.

Martina Hingis is the youngest female Slam champion in the Open era

Martina Hingis - 16 years, 117 days (Australian Open, 1997)

The 'Swiss Miss' is still the youngest female Slam champion in the Open era, winning the 1997 Australian Open by beating Mary Pierce. She went on to win five Grand Slam singles titles in total.

Hingis first retired in 2003 after two ankle surgeries. She returned to competition in non-tour events in 2005 before announcing her comeback to the WTA Tour a year later.

In 2007, Hingis was investigated for testing positive for a metabolite of cocaine and was suspended by the International Tennis Federation for two years.

She made a third return to the sport in 2015, focusing more on doubles, winning four Slam titles in women's doubles and six mixed doubles titles before retiring for a final time in 2017.

Monica Seles - 16 years, 189 days (French Open 1990)

Seles won eight Slam titles before she turned 20, but, in 1993, was the victim of an on-court knife attack. She returned to the tour in 1995 and won another major, but struggled to find her best form. She played her last official tour match at the 2003 French Open.

Tracey Austin - 16 years, 270 days (US Open, 1979)

Austin remains the youngest US Open champion in history and added another title in 1981.

The American struggled with injuries after that and was often sidelined for long periods. She attempted a comeback in 1988 but had a near-fatal road accident a year later. She attempted another return in 1993, but finally retired the following year.

Maria Sharapova - 17 years, 75 days (Wimbledon, 2004)

Famously beat Serena Williams in the final at Wimbledon 17 years ago to claim her maiden major trophy. The Russian went on to win a total of five Slam titles, including two French Opens on clay - a surface on which she famously described herself as being a ""cow on ice"".

Sharapova retired in 2020 after being hampered by shoulder injuries in the latter stages of her career. She had served a 15-month suspension from the sport after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.

Michael Chang - 17 years, 110 days (French Open, 1989)

Michael Chang is the youngest male Slam winner, but despite making two more finals, never won another one

The most notable to win only one is the youngest male Slam champion Chang, who beat Stefan Edberg at Roland Garros in 1989.

Despite reaching a world ranking of number two in the world and a total of 34 career titles, the American was unable to get over the line in the Australian Open and US Open finals in 1996.

Arantxa Sanchez Vicario - 17 years, 174 days (French Open, 1989)

Having followed older brothers Emilio and Javier Sanchez into the sport, the Spaniard upset Steffi Graf to make history at Roland Garros.

Two more Paris triumphs followed - including her last Slam in 1998 - and a US Open success in 1994, while she was runner-up twice at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. She also claimed six women's doubles and four mixed doubles titles before retiring in 2002.

Two years later, Sanchez Vicario returned to play in the 2004 Olympics - her fifth appearance in the Games, from which she has two silver and bronze medals.

Boris Becker - 17 years, 228 days (Wimbledon, 1985)

At the time the dynamic German won his first Wimbledon title, he was the youngest male player to win a Slam in the Open era.

Becker was also unseeded when he started his run, although he was 20 in the ATP rankings as seedings only went up to 16 back then.

He went on to win Wimbledon twice more, plus two Australian Open titles and the 1989 US Open.

Mats Wilander - 17 years, 293 days (French Open, 1982)

The Swede made his mark when he won the French Open as an unseeded player, defeating Guillermo Vilas.

Wilander went on to win seven Slam titles in total with his best year in 1988 when he won three of the four, only missing out at Wimbledon.

He never won the singles title at SW19 but did win the men's doubles in SW19 with compatriot Joakim Nystrom in 1986.

A three-time Davis Cup winner with Sweden, he was handed a three-month suspension by the ITF, having tested positive for cocaine at the 1995 French Open, and retired a year later.

Serena Williams - 17 years, 350 days (US Open, 1999)

Still active and still chasing the elusive 24th Grand Slam singles title which would draw her level with record-holder Margaret Court, Williams has seen her attempts in recent years thwarted.

She won the US Open in her first final, beating fellow teenager Hingis.

She first became a world number one in 2002, but has been troubled with injuries recently. Her last Slam title came in 2017, when she won the Australian Open while in the early stages of pregnancy.

Steffi Graf - 17 years, 357 days (French Open, 1987)

Graf's arrival on the scene was in the years of Martina Navratilova's dominance, and the German beat the then world number one for a first French Open success.

She won a 'Golden Slam' of all four majors and Olympic gold in 1988, finishing with 22 major singles titles in her career.

Knee and wrist injuries beset the latter stages of her career and she retired at the age of 30 in 1999, when she was still ranked world number three and had just won the French Open and reached the Wimbledon final.

Bjorn Borg - 18 years, 10 days (French Open, 1974)

Borg's breakthrough as a teenage sensation in the mid-1970s helped make tennis front-page news.

The Swede won 11 Slams - six French Opens and five Wimbledons - and he will be forever remembered for the epic 1980 showpiece against John McEnroe at SW19.

His initial retirement at the age of 26 in 1983 was a shock to the tennis world. He attempted a comeback between 1991-1993, but failed to win a match on the ATP Tour.

Rafael Nadal - 19 years, 3 days (French Open, 2005)

Nadal is the only member of the 'Big Three' of himself, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic to win his first Slam title as a teenager.

He has won an unprecedented 13 at the French Open, together with seven at other majors. Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are all currently tied on 20 Slam titles each.

The 35-year-old has struggled with injury throughout his career and ended his 2021 season last month because of a recurring left-foot problem.

Other teenagers who also won Slams

Pete Sampras, aged 19 years and 29 days, landed the 1990 US Open with victory over Andre Agassi. It was the first of the American's 14 career majors, which included seven at Wimbledon. It was a record total in men's tennis until surpassed by Roger Federer in 2009.

Aged 19 years and 324 days, success in the 1985 Australian Open final against fellow Swede Mats Wilander was the first of Stefan Edberg's six career Slams.

On the women's side, Hana Mandlikova became the second-youngest female player to win a Grand Slam at the time when she beat Australian Wendy Turnbull in the 1980 Australian Open final. The Prague-born player, who was then aged 18 years and 329 days, would win three more Slams in her career before retiring a decade later.

Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova won two Slams in her career, the first in the US Open, aged 19 years and 76 days, when she beat compatriot Elena Dementieva. She also landed the 2009 French Open.

Bianca Andreescu stunned Serena Williams at the US Open in 2019, aged 19 years and 83 days, but has been plagued with injuries ever since.

Iga Swiatek won the 2020 French Open aged 19 years and 132 days, beating Sofia Kenin, but the Polish player has yet to follow that up.

American Chris Evert claimed the first of her 18 singles Grand Slams when she beat Olga Morozova in the 1974 French Open final at the age of 19 years and 176 days.

Iva Majoli upset Martina Hingis to win her only Slam title in the 1997 French Open aged 19 years and 299 days, ending Hingis' 37-match winning streak and handing the Swiss her first defeat in a Grand Slam final.

Australia's Evonne Goolagong, aged 19 years and 309 days, lifted the French Open in 1971, beating Helen Gourlay for the first of her seven majors.","['list', 'open', 'french', '19', 'raducanu', 'slam', 'titles', 'win', 'title', 'illustrious', 'emma', 'teen', 'won', 'australian', 'winners', 'days', 'joins']","She had served a 15-month suspension from the sport after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.

147,Let's talk about sex — in space,"German astronaut Matthias Maurer breezes through interviews, rarely missing a beat when he answers journalists' questions around his upcoming six-month trip to the International Space Station (ISS). But one topic throws even Maurer off momentarily: sex drive in space.

""We haven't talked about this, because it's a professional environment,"" he replied to DW's question on whether astronauts exchange insights on how to handle their desires.

Thanks to commercial spaceflights, more people are entering the cosmos than ever before. Just this past week,SpaceX launched four tourists through the Earth's orbit. Ten years from now, the first crew of astronauts will likely set off on a mission to Mars that could last multiple years.

Sexuality is intrinsic to human nature and inevitably factors into space missions. But while space science is progressing, our understanding of sex in space is still basic.

NASA, the US' National Aeronautics and Space Administration, insists that no humans have had sex in space, and American astronauts famously avoid the topic. The few experiments that have been conducted on space sex focused on animals, not humans.

""We need to know more about sexuality in space if we are serious about long-duration space flights. Sexuality is very possibly going to be a part of that,"" Paul Root Wolpe, who spent 15 years as a senior bioethicist at NASA, told DW.

German astronaut Matthias Maurer told DW that there is no official training on sexuality in space

Sex in space matters

Addressing sexuality in space isn't just important because it's what's on everyone's mind. Asked by DW whether sexuality is part of an astronaut's training, Matthias Maurer replied: ""No, but maybe it should be.""

""If we look at sexual health as a core component of health, it's important to understand the conditions we are putting individuals in,"" Saralyn Mark, former senior medical adviser to NASA, told DW.

Sex and masturbation are linked to physical and mental health — that doesn't change in space.

Ejaculation is essential for men to avoid the risk of bacteria building up in their prostate, and orgasms have been shown to relieve stress and anxiety as well as improve sleep quality, which likely helps during a high-pressure space mission.

Has it already happened?

We can only speculate, but it seems likely that sex in space has already happened. There are two space missions that jump out as candidates for the first cosmic coitus.

In 1982, Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, the second-ever woman in space, joined the Soyuz T-7 space mission for eight days. Two male colleagues were already on board when she arrived, making it the first coed space mission.

In his book, Höllenritt durch Raum und Zeit (A hell ride through time and space), German astronaut Ulrich Walter notes that, according to the team's doctor, Oleg Georgievich Gazenko, the flight was planned with a sexual encounter in mind.

The second mission in question took place in 1992, when NASA's Space Shuttle Endeavor was launched with a married couple on board. Mark Lee and Jan Davis, both astronauts, met at NASA. They married in secret a year before liftoff. Their joint flight to space was practically their honeymoon.

Svetlana Savitskaya (right), Anatoly Berezovoy (left) and Valentin Lebedev made up the world's first mixed-sex space crew

How is it different from here on Earth?

So, we can assume that sex in space is a reality. But how is it different to ours on Earth? Let's start with the basics: sex drive.

The little publicly available information that we have indicates that being in space leads to reduced libido, at least at first.

That's because microgravity, the weightlessness astronauts experience in space, causes hormonal changes, like decreases in estrogen. Low estrogen levels have been linked to a drop in sex drive.

Unfortunately, most of what we know about hormones in space comes only from tests on men. That's because only 11.5% of astronauts are female, and the relatively few women who have been to space opted to go on birth control beforehand to avoid menstruation. This makes it tricky to disentangle artificial hormonal changes from those caused by space flight.

Another factor in cosmic sex drive is a change in astronauts' internal clock.

""When you're going around the planet right now, every 90 minutes, your circadian rhythms are altered and that alters everything, including your sex hormones and probably your libido,"" said Saralyn Mark.

The science also matches astronaut Walter's on-site experience. In his book, he writes that, during his short 10-day stay in space, he had no libido.

But there's hope: According to Walter, astronauts' sex drive does readjust after a few weeks in space.

Astronauts and arousal

While our knowledge of sex drive is still fuzzy, we have a much clearer picture on whether humans can get physically aroused in space.

Microgravity causes blood flow to reverse its course and move upwards, towards the head and chest, instead of circulating in the lower half of the body. The internet abounds with speculation on whether this prevents men from getting erections in space.

When asked whether space boners are viable, Mark gave a clear answer: ""Yes, microgravity does not affect that path.""

Root Wolpe agreed: ""There is no reason why it should be biologically impossible.""

Ron Garan, an American astronaut who went to space twice, was asked whether erections are possible in space on an Ask Me Anything Reddit thread.

""I know of nothing that happens to the human body on Earth that can't happen in space,"" he answered.

For women, arousal in space is possible as well but getting wet feels physically different than on planet Earth. In zero gravity, liquids collect at their point of origin, meaning they form a blob at the spot where they are secreted, instead of flowing freely.

Astronauts Mark Lee and Jan Davis spent their honeymoon aboard a space shuttle

Velcro and dolphin sex

So much for the biological basics. Now we are left with speculating about the act itself. One thing is certain: Sex in space is a far more exhausting endeavor than here on Earth.

In zero gravity, Newton's third law, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, makes thrusting against each other a real challenge.

""We don't realize how much gravity assists us in the act of intercourse,"" said Wolpe. ""Sex involves pressure. In space, without any counterforce, you end up constantly pushing your partner away from you.""

But where there's a will, there's a way.

In an interview with German public broadcaster NDR, Walter suggested that astronauts could adopt a method employed by dolphins in the ocean, where a third party holds the other two together to prevent them from drifting.

Wolpe has another idea: ""Everything on the walls of the space station is covered in Velcro, so you could take advantage of that by velcroing one partner to the wall. You have to get creative in this space.""","['sex', 'drive', 'lets', 'sexuality', 'talk', 'mark', 'wolpe', 'walter', 'space', 'astronauts', 'astronaut', 'maurer']","But one topic throws even Maurer off momentarily: sex drive in space.

148,Eastern Cape woman found guilty of stealing R330 000 in Road Accident Fund money from stepchildren,"An Eastern Cape woman has been found guilty of stealing R331 000 from her stepchildren.

The money was part of a Road Accident Fund claim made on behalf of the children.

The woman was not the children's caregiver, as stated in the claim.

An Eastern Cape woman has been found guilty of stealing more than R330 000 in a Road Accident Fund (RAF) claim intended to benefit her stepchildren. She has been handed a six-year suspended sentence and ordered to repay the stolen funds.

Nyameka Mkhatshwa, 49, was convicted and sentenced in the East London Regional Court on charges of theft on Tuesday. The theft relates to a 2014 claim made by Mkhatshwa on behalf of the children, said Hawks spokesperson Captain Yolisa Mgolodela.

""On 14 July 2014, Mkhatshwa lodged a claim with the RAF on behalf of her stepchildren after the death of her husband in a motor vehicle accident. The claim was settled by the RAF and an amount of more than R331 000 was paid into her account,"" said Mgolodela.

However, the court heard that Mkhatshwa did not give the money to the stepchildren.

""In her affidavit in support of the claim, she said that she was staying with the children and was supporting them, whereas she never lived with nor supported them,"" said Mgolodela.

A complaint was lodged with the Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation team in East London for investigation, which led to Mkhatshwa's arrest on 16 March 2021.

At the time, she was released on a warning by the East London Magistrate's Court.

""After several court appearances, she received a six-year suspended sentence. She was further ordered to repay the victims an amount of R100 000 on or before 1 October 2021 and the balance in monthly instalments over a period of 60 months,"" said Mgolodela.

149,Prophet Mohammed cartoonist killed in car crash,"Prophet Mohammed cartoonist killed in car crash

Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks was living under police protection.

STOCKHOLM: Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, who lived under police protection after his 2007 depiction of the Prophet Mohammed prompted death threats, was killed on Sunday in a road accident.

The 75-year-old and two police officers were killed in a collision with an oncoming truck, Swedish police confirmed to AFP.

""This is being investigated like any other road accident. Because two policemen were involved, an investigation has been assigned to a special section of the prosecutor's office,"" a police spokesperson told AFP, adding that there was no suspicion of foul play.

The accident occurred near the small town Markaryd when the car Vilks was travelling in crashed into an oncoming truck. Both vehicles caught fire and the truck driver was hospitalised, according to police.

In a statement, the police said the cause of the accident was unclear.

""The person we were protecting and two colleagues died in this inconceivable and terribly sad tragedy,"" said regional police head Carina Persson.

Vilks had been under police protection since his 2007 cartoon of Mohammed with a dog's body prompted outrage among those who consider depictions of the Muslim prophet deeply offensive or blasphemous.

Al-Qaeda offered a $100,000 reward for Vilks' murder.

The depiction also sparked diplomatic friction, with Sweden's then prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt meeting ambassadors from several Muslim countries to ease tensions.

In 2015, Vilks survived a gun attack at a free-speech conference in Copenhagen that left a Danish film director dead.","['protection', 'car', 'road', 'cartoonist', 'vilks', 'killed', 'truck', 'crash', 'prophet', 'mohammed', 'swedish', 'accident']","Prophet Mohammed cartoonist killed in car crashSwedish cartoonist Lars Vilks was living under police protection.

152,Bride and groom respond to road accident hours before wedding,"On Monday afternoon September 20th, a Muslim bride, Nour Abu Asi, and her groom, Mohamed Byadsi, were driving back from taking pre-wedding photos outside of their hometown of Jatt, an Arab-Israeli town located in the triangle region of Israel when they spotted a motor vehicle accident involving a young boy on his bicycle and a truck. Even though they were dressed in their wedding attire, the couple, both of whom are United Hatzalah volunteer first responders, didn’t hesitate to stop by the accident and provide emergency medical treatment to the injured nine-year-old boy.

“The boy was riding his bicycle when he suddenly swerved and hit the truck causing himself to sustain some serious lacerations and contusions,” said Mohamed. “I didn’t think twice, as I pulled the car over. Nour and I both got out in our wedding attire and rushed over to assist the young boy while we called United Hatzalah’s Dispatch and Command Center and requested additional volunteers and an ambulance. Our wedding activities would be put on hold for a while as this boy needed our help,” he added.

Nour, who in addition to being a first responder for United Hatzalah is also a nurse in Tel HaShomer Hospital, bandaged the boy’s hands while her husband-to-be, Mohamed, checked the boy’s vital signs and took an oral history of his young patient. “The boy was crying and we tried to comfort him while we bandaged up his wounds. He was scared and so we asked the dispatcher to try to get in touch with his parents while we treated him,” said Nour.

When the boy’s parents arrived at the scene, they declined an ambulance transport and instead took the boy to a nearby hospital on their own. They thanked the almost-newlyweds for their help in treating their son after the accident.

When the boy was treated and his parents had taken him to the hospital for further care, Nour and Mohamed got back into their car and headed back to the wedding hall for the ceremony. “Wherever I go and whatever I am doing, I feel a sense of responsibility to help others because I have the training and ability to do so,” added Mohamed. “Wearing my wedding suit, in the middle of my wedding day, that is when God decides to test me and see if I will still live up to my responsibility of helping others. Of course I decided to stop the car and help. What else can a volunteer EMT do on his own wedding day? What better way to celebrate than by helping others? Nour and I didn’t even think twice, we jumped at the opportunity to help. I am thankful that we passed this first test of our marriage together and we helped another person while doing so.”","['respond', 'hours', 'wedding', 'groom', 'road', 'boy', 'mohamed', 'hospital', 'bride', 'didnt', 'parents', 'nour', 'united', 'young', 'help', 'accident']","“The boy was riding his bicycle when he suddenly swerved and hit the truck causing himself to sustain some serious lacerations and contusions,” said Mohamed.

153,Kenyan policeman wakes up from coma to find he was sacked,"A Kenyan police officer has woken up from a nine-month coma to find he had been sacked for desertion.

Neither the family nor the police force had any idea where Constable Reuben Kimutai Lel was - his niece told the BBC they thought he was dead.

But it turns out that he had been the victim of a road accident and had been in one of the country's biggest hospitals all along.

He only regained consciousness last week.

His niece Joan Jeptoo told the BBC of the family's horror as they searched for his body in morgues after they had given up on his chances of being alive.

At one point they almost collected a decomposing body from a morgue that was said to be him.

""We thought he was dead because his phone was off. Early this year we went to collect a body that we were told resembled him, but the fingerprints didn't match,"" she said.

The police officer was admitted on 21 December 2020 as an unknown person at the main referral hospital in the capital, Nairobi. He had no identity documents with him.

Meanwhile, he was sacked from his job, charged in absentia with desertion and a warrant was issued for his arrest. The case was later withdrawn after police failed to find him.

He regained consciousness last week, and although he has still not regained his full memory, he was able to identify himself by name and that he was a police officer - and so the search for his relatives began.

His niece was contacted by police last Wednesday and was told to go and identify him at hospital.

""I found him at Kenyatta National Hospital. He could not recognise me and he could not recognise names of members of his family,"" she said.

The police officer was discharged from hospital last Friday and is recuperating at his home in Koibatek, Baringo county, under the care of his wife and family.

According to the Daily Nation news site, arrangements are being made to reinstate him to the police force.

However, his niece said the constable, in his late 50s, was looking forward to his retirement.","['coma', 'kenyan', 'officer', 'policeman', 'sacked', 'body', 'told', 'hospital', 'recognise', 'wakes', 'saidthe', 'thought', 'niece', 'regained']","A Kenyan police officer has woken up from a nine-month coma to find he had been sacked for desertion.

154,Disabled boy who is also full time carer for unwell dad is denied PIP support twice,"PIP is meant to help people with long-term physical or mental health conditions or disabilities. The support can be up to £152.15 a week - but many severely ill people say they have been denied support

Exclusive: Disabled boy who is also full time carer for unwell dad is denied PIP support twice

A father and son who have arthritis and learning difficulties between them say they are struggling to get by after being rejected twice for Personal Independence Payments (PIP).

Their case shows how easy it is for people to fall down the cracks in the PIP system and not get the benefit they need.

PIP is meant to help people with long-term physical or mental health conditions or disabilities. The support can be up to £152.15 a week.

But many report finding it hard to get PIP payments and are rejected by assessors working for DWP.

Two people grappling with PIP unsuccessfully are David Rhind, 52, and his son Christoper Rhind, 22.

The Rhinds, who live in Aberdeenshire, say the lack of PIP is making a huge difference to their lives.

Image: David Rhind) David Rhind)

David has bad arthritis and needs full-time care.

Christopher has learning difficulties and went to a special needs school. He is on medication for sleep deprivation, depression and breathlessness, has anxiety and has thoughts of self-harming, his father said, and has bitten his fingernails off.

David's wife was his carer, before she sadly passed away in November last year after not fully recovering from a road accident.

Now Christopher has stepped in to care for his father, helping him wash and dress, as well as cleaning the house and cooking.

But the reality is that the father and son care for each other.

David said: ""My son is now my carer and I help him as much as I can. He helps me wash, dress and he cleans the house with a little help from me as I can't do much and he helps me down in the village as he can't make a journey alone.

""I write things down for him so he remembers and I help him cook. He does all the lifting, and I tell him the temperature and time things need for cooking.

""My wife showed him how to use the washing machine and when he goes out I have to be with him or he would get lost.""

Christopher had an assessment for PIP in as soon as he left school.

Technically he is eligible for PIP because anxiety, cognitive disorders and learning disorders are qualifying factors for the benefit.

But he never got the benefit, as he was so overcome with worry on the journey to his first PIP assessment that he became ill and had to return home.

He was assessed again on July 17 this year, but was rejected again.

Most recently the PIP assessor said if he can care for his father, he can plan a journey or cook a meal unaided - both signs someone can cope and doesn't need PIP.

David said: ""He's on meds for his nerves and meds for sleep deprivation, and a salbutamol inhaler which he uses now and again. But yet PIP say if you suffer any mental health issue you are entitled to [the benefit], which is all lies - they're uncaring and unhuman.""

The second rejection knocked Christopher's health, his father said.

""As he told me, no one cares,"" David said. ""But he said I'm his rock, and I said he is mine.

""PIP to my son would help him a great deal, as with his medical health it would help him a lot. He has never had any savings as he can't work, and is now my full-time carer.""

DWP has been approached for comment.

Thousands of PIP assessments overturned in court

Around 293,000 people across the UK have overturned a government decision to deny them Personal Independence Payments (PIP) in the past three years.

It stems from a High Court ruling in December 2017 that found the DWP had not correctly followed regulations for the points given for being able to go on journeys.

Claimants should have been awarded the standard mobility rate of PIP if their psychological distress meant they were unable to undertake any unfamiliar journey without having someone with them.

And they should have been given the enhanced rate if they could not go on any familiar journey without support.

But instead the DWP had been underscoring people for this part of the assessment, meaning some didn't qualify for the mobility rate of PIP at all.

When asked about the failures, the DWP said new information came to light at the tribunal.

The department is now reassessing claims and making adjustments that will mean extra cash and a big back payment for many who were turned down the first time around.","['carer', 'david', 'pip', 'denied', 'health', 'say', 'disabled', 'help', 'unwell', 'boy', 'journey', 'dad', 'father', 'rhind', 'twice', 'son', 'support']","Two people grappling with PIP unsuccessfully are David Rhind, 52, and his son Christoper Rhind, 22.

155,Klub i sorg: 23-årig fransk fodboldspiller død efter ulykke,"En tragedie i fransk fodbold er hændt.

OGC Nice oplyser søndag på Twitter, at den tidligere Nice-spiller Rémi Mestrallet er død efter en trafikulykke.

Klubben skriver, at de er i stor sorg over nyheden.

Søndag drog Nice nordpå, hvor de skulle møde Nantes. Nice vandt kampen 0-2 og sendte efterfølgende tanker mod franskmanden, der kun blev 23 år.

We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Rémi Mestrallet (23 years old) in a road accident.



Before leaving for Étoile Fréjus/St-Raphaël this summer, the defensive midfielder was a member of the & Academy.

»Denne sejr er dedikeret til ham,« skrev klubben.

En af Nices mere velkendte ansigter, Dante, der også har spillet i Bayern München, var også påvirket efter opgøret:

»Vi står med blandede følelser. Vi hørte, at vi mistede et tidligere talent fra vores talentakademi. På trods af sejren var der intet eufori. Vi kondolerer og sender tanker til familien,« siger Dante ifølge det franske medie RMC.

Rémi Mestrallet fik sin fodboldopdragelse på Nices fodboldakademi, men han nåede dog aldrig at spille en officiel seniorkamp for førsteholdet.

Franskmandens nok største fodboldmæssige højdepunkter var, da han spillede i to træningskampe imod henholdsvis Rangers og Celtic. I juli 2021 skiftede han til den franske klub Fréjus-Saint-Raphaël FC.

156,Overspeeding leading cause of road crashes – FRSC,"By Steve Oko

The Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, has identified overspeeding as the leading cause of road crashes in Nigeria.

The Abia State Sector Commander of FRSC, Mr. Paul Ugwu who disclosed this in an exclusive chat with Vanguard, cautioned motorists against overspeeding and other traffic offenses.

He said the corp would tomorrow (Tuesday) flag off ’ember months’ safety campaign as part of measures to minimise road traffic offenses in the state ahead of the Yuletide.

The FRSC boss said that the corps would also conduct free vision, high blood pressure and other vital tests for commercial vehicle drivers in Abia during the campaign.

He gave the theme of this year’s campaign as: “Maintain Speed, Avoid Night Travels and Enjoy Quality Road Experience”.

Ugwu said that the target of the campaign was to reduce road crashes by 15% and fatality by 20%.

He disclosed that ambulances would be deployed and positioned along critical corridors of the state during the “ember months to ensure road accident victims are attended to within five minutes”.

The FRSC boss advised motorists especially passenger- vehicles against night travels saying that statistics has shown that most road crashes occur at night.

He also advised motorists to ensure they posses valid driver’s license and vehicle documents, warming that road traffic offenders especially those guilty of lane indiscipline, overloading, drunk-driving, using mobile phone while on the wheel risk prosecution at the mobile court during the season.

The FRSC boss who also threatened to impound mechanically deficient vehicles, advised motorists to ensure they have sound spare tyre to avoid getting stranded on the way.

“Your spare tyre should be your best tyre not any how tyre”, he advised.

He said that contrary to perceptions in some quarters, the corps is not all about catching road traffic offenders but sometimes conduct free safety checks and offer advice without booking offenders.

157,NUPENG to commence strike on Monday,"The National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) says its Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) will commence strike on Monday over the deplorable state of the nation’s highways and other issues.

Mr Tayo Aboyeji, the South-West Zonal Chairman of NUPENG, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos said the union has lost many lives and properties due to bad roads.

Aboyeji said that all tanker drivers from the union would withdraw their services nationwide.

“This is not the first time that we will signify our intention to go on strike but we have to call it off because it will generally affect majority of Nigerians but now our hands are tied.

“We are going on nationwide strike because of the deplorable and shameful state of our highways.

“When a truck loads petrol in Lagos, the drivers spend five to six days to get to Abuja because of the shameful state of the roads.

“All calls by the executive of petroleum unions have fallen on the deaf ears of the government as the highways continue to deteriorate nationwide.

“The list of the highway are endless and the tanker drivers have been going through harrowing situation while rendering selfless national service.

“The increase rate of fire incidences involving petroleum tankers with accompanying massive destruction of lives and properties of our members and general public is enough.

“This is because of government failure to enforce installation of safety gadget on tanker.

“This will protect the inflammation contents of their trucks from spilling over in a situation of road accident.

“There are some trucks that carry 60,000 litres to 100,000 litres on the highway.

“This load has a negative effect and impact on the safety and control of drivers on the wheel as well as durability and sustainability of the highway.

“The unions do not want any truck to carry more than the approved capacity,” he said.

160,Funeral details announced for Gorey man (22) who died following collision,"Finlay (right) with his classmates having won the Amber flag for mental health.

The funeral of a young Gorey man who died following a road accident last weekend will take place at noon this Friday in Christ Church Gorey.

Finlay Power (22) will be reposing at Murphy's Funeral Home, The Avenue, Gorey, tomorrow (Thursday, September 16) from 3 p.m. until 8 p.m. The removal will take place on Friday at 11.30 a.m. to Christ Church, Gorey for funeral followed by private cremation.

Finlay from Annagh, Hollyfort, was the son of James and Catherine Power, brother to James and Erin and partner of Nicole.

He had been a member of Gorey Civil Defence for the past two years and had attended a training session with the group the evening before the accident, which took place on the N2 at Edmonstown, County Louth, on Saturday last.

Speaking before news of Finlay’s death emerged, his Gorey Civil Defence colleague Celestine Swords described him as “the sort of lad who was always eager, and he’d help us in any way that he could as a volunteer. He is very popular in all circles and everyone would describe him as a gentleman.”

On Monday, his former principal Linda Dunne said that, during his time at Coláiste Bhride, Carnew, Finlay was a reliable, hard-working young man who “always got things done and was willing to help out”. She said Finlay was pivotal in the school achieving an amber award for mental health and everyone could see the leadership potential he held.

""Finlay would have been instrumental in that and was very generous with his time and you don’t get very many young people who are like that with volunteerism,” she said.

Tributes have been pouring in online and neighbour to the Power family, Cllr Anthony Donohoe, sent his sympathies to the family.

""My deepest sympathies go out to the Power family on the loss of their son Finlay following this tragic incident. There is a deep sense of sadness in the Annagh and Hollyfort areas as a dark cloud hangs over the area.

161,Kinahan associate Raffaele Imperiale involved in horror Ferrari crash that killed one man,"Daniel Kinahan’s Italian mafia associate Raffaele Imperiale was the “protagonist” of a serious road accident while driving a Ferrari in which one man died, Italian investigators have claimed.

The claim was made in new documents filed by Italian prosecutors as part of their case against drug trafficker Imperiale.

The 46-year-old boss of the Naples-based Camorra organisation is currently facing extradition to Italy from Dubai where he was arrested in August.

According to prosecutors, one of Imperiale's associates, who was behind the wheel of a Lamborghini, was also involved in the fatal crash in Spain.

But according to one informer who is co-operating with Italian authorities, Imperiale abandoned his car Ferrari following the crash - despite the fact it was worth a six-figure sum.

""He did not show disappointment that the prestigious cars had been destroyed, as he had a lot of money,” the informer has claimed.

The details are included in statements given to Italy’s Direzione Investigativa Antimafia ('Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate'), also known as DIA, from numerous “collaborators of justice”.

These include Carmine Cerrato, the former right-hand man of Imperiale’s fellow mafia boss Lelluccio Amato.

Imperiale had been wanted by Italian authorities since 2016 to serve an eight year sentence for drug trafficking before his arrest in Dubai.

The Mafia Don was secretly arrested in his luxury Dubai villa while he was in the pool with his wife and four children.

Imperiale is a known associate of Daniel Kinahan and was a guest at his 2017 wedding in Dubai.

The Naples review court has now ordered that Imperiale must remain in prison in Dubai after rejecting a request by his lawyers that he freed pending his extradition.

The court made the decision after hearing Imperiale is not a ""simple drug supplier"" but ""one of the pillars on which the whole Camorra organization of the Di Lauro clan splinters rests"".

Prosecutors also claim Imperiale has ties with the leaders of Holland's notorious 'Mocro Maffia', lead by Ridouan Taghi.

Imperiale is believed to be one of the leaders of a 'super-cartel' which controls a major portion of Europe's lucrative cocaine trade.

Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) documents sent to Dutch police identified Imperiale, Dutch mobster Ridouan Taghi, Bosnian criminal Edin Gačanin, Richard 'El Rico' Vega and Daniel Kinahan as the heads of a so-called ‘super drug cartel.’

According to the DEA, Imperiale, Taghi and Edin Gačanin also attended Kinahan’s wedding at the plush Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai in 2017.

The DEA documents described the ‘super drugs cartel’ as one of the world’s fifty largest drug cartels, with a virtual monopoly of the Peruvian cocaine trade.

The documents said the ‘super drugs cartel’ controlled around a third of the cocaine trade into Europe – with the main point of access through Dutch ports.

Born in Italy, Imperiale’s criminal career began in earnest in 1996 when an older brother who died bequeathed him the Rockland coffee shop in Amsterdam.

From here Imperiale is alleged to have embarked on his criminal career by selling ‘soft’ drugs before expanding into cocaine trafficking with Dutch drug trader Rick van de Bunt.

Imperiale was later introduced by Antonio Orefice, a member of the Moccia clan, to Elio Amato, brother of Raffaele Amato, who was at that time one of the top drug traffickers of the Di Lauro clan.

During those years Imperiale earned millions of euros, becoming the point of contact for the Di Lauro’s organization in dealing with drug trafficking cartels in Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.

Imperiale is also known to be a fanatical collector of art works.

In 2016, two Van Gogh paintings, stolen from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in 2002, were recovered in a villa in Castellammare di Stabia, owned by him.

According to authorities, Imperiale was spending a fortune maintaining a lavish lifestyle in Dubai.

In March of this year further evidence emerged of the links between the Kinahan cartel and Imperiale at the trial of Richard ‘El Rico’ Riquelme in Amsterdam.

Judges heard briefly from the prosecution how Kinahan, was a “regular contact” of Riquelme’s and was in a video on a phone seized from him following his arrest and extradition to Holland from Chile in 2017.

In June, Riquelme was sentenced to 11 years in prison after being found guilty of operating an assassination ring and laundering drug money.

His trial heard he had exchanged phone messages organising gangland murders with jailed drug boss Taghi.","['di', 'man', 'italian', 'associate', 'cocaine', 'drug', 'raffaele', 'involved', 'ferrari', 'imperiale', 'killed', 'dutch', 'dubai', 'documents', 'crash', 'kinahan', 'horror', 'van']","Daniel Kinahan’s Italian mafia associate Raffaele Imperiale was the “protagonist” of a serious road accident while driving a Ferrari in which one man died, Italian investigators have claimed.

162,"Three killed, two injured in Bauchi road accident","The Federal Road Safety Corps in Bauchi State has confirmed that three people were killed in a fatal crash that occurred on Tuesday at Dungulbi village, close to the Muslim burial ground site.

Our correspondent learnt that two people also sustained varying degrees of injury in the crash.

The state Sector Commander, FRSC, Yusuf Abdullahi, disclosed this in a telephone interview with our correspondent on Wednesday.

He said the crash involved a Station Wagon Opel Vectra, with number plate DSA-120 AA, and a commercial Toyota Hiace, Gombe Mass Transit, with number plate GME-74 YX.

Abdullahi said, “The incident, involving six male adults, happened opposite the Muslim Burial Ground junction yesterday (Tuesday) around 8.32pm. Immediately we got the information, we rushed to the scene within 26 minutes.

“The crash was caused by a tyre burst and this was confirmed to our men by the passengers who survived.

“The tyre burst led to the crash because when it happened, the driver lost control and then had a head-on collision with the car in the opposite direction.

“The victims were rushed to the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital, Bauchi, for treatment and confirmation. At the hospital, three of them were confirmed dead. Two others sustained varying degrees of injury.

“The driver of the bus, who was trapped, died as a result of the fire, while two passengers in the other vehicle died.”

He explained that the station wagon vehicle was not engulfed by fire, while the Toyota Hiace bus caught fire after the crash happened.

Abdullahi advised drivers against speeding, night travels, and other practices that put their lives and those of other road users at risk.

163,ECOWAS seeks efficient road transportation,"The Economic Community of West African States has advocated an effective and efficient road transport system in the region.

The Commissioner in charge of Infrastructure at the ECOWAS Commission, Mr Pathe Gueye, at the validation workshop for the draft road safety policy for the ECOWAS region held in Lagos, said there was the need for harmonisation of the highway design codes in the ECOWAS region.

He said, “Road Safety is an important element for the security in West Africa and the World. In 2016, the World Health Organisation in its report informed us that there were more than 6,000 cases of road accident deaths. If we bring that to a population of 1,000 inhabitants, we are about an average of three to five death ratio. This ratio is higher compared to the ratio given by the WHO and it is five times higher than what is obtainable in Europe.

“This shows that the necessity for West Africa to take the responsibility of road safety issue seriously is very important. We have also observed that those who are involved in those road accidents are aged between 16 and 25, which constitute the youths of our sub-region.

“Therefore, the ECOWAS Commission cannot fold its arms and continue to watch our youths die. There is the need to harmonise a framework so that the solution can be sought to improve on this situation.”

The Deputy Corps Marshall, Operations, Federal Road Safety Commission, Mr Kayode Fanola, said Nigeria would benefit from the ECOWAS draft policy on road safety.

“We have made inputs into the draft policy where we articulated what Nigeria has done, the legislation we have and the Nigerian Road Safety Strategy was also highlighted,” he said.

164,Why we’ll go on strike Dec 11 -NUPENG,"The National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers says its Petroleum Tanker Drivers will commence strike on Monday, December 11, over the deplorable state of the nation’s highways and other issues.

The South-West Zonal Chairman of NUPENG, Mr Tayo Aboyeji, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria in Lagos said the union has lost many lives and properties due to bad roads.

Aboyeji said that all tanker drivers from the union would withdraw their services nationwide.

“This is not the first time that we will signify our intention to go on strike but we have to call it off because it will generally affect majority of Nigerians but now our hands are tied.

“We are going on nationwide strike because of the deplorable and shameful state of our highways.

“When a truck loads petrol in Lagos, the drivers spend five to six days to get to Abuja because of the shameful state of the roads.

“All calls by the executive of petroleum unions have fallen on the deaf ears of the government as the highways continue to deteriorate nationwide.

“The list of the highway are endless and the tanker drivers have been going through harrowing situation while rendering selfless national service.

“The increase rate of fire incidences involving petroleum tankers with accompanying massive destruction of lives and properties of our members and general public is enough.

“This is because of government failure to enforce installation of safety gadget on tanker.

“This will protect the inflammation contents of their trucks from spilling over in a situation of road accident.

“We see the failure of the government in this regards as height of insensitivity to lives of innocent Nigerians and union cannot continue to hold its hands while our members are getting burnt everywhere and everyday,” he said.

The zonal chairman said the union is not happy with the unscrupulous abuse of tonnage.

“There are some trucks that carry 60,000 litres to 100,000 litres on the highway.

“This load has a negative effect and impact on the safety and control of drivers on the wheel as well as durability and sustainability of the highway.

“The unions do not want any truck to carry more than the approved capacity,” he said.

Aboyeji said the union had given notice to the government to put all these in order to avert the nationwide strike on Dec. 11.

“We know that the present administration would not do anything until we start the nationwide strike,” he said.

He had been a member of Gorey Civil Defence for the past two years and had attended a training session with the group the evening before the accident, which took place on the N2 at Edmonstown, County Louth, on Saturday last.

Speaking before news of Finlay’s death emerged, his Gorey Civil Defence colleague Celestine Swords described him as “the sort of lad who was always eager, and he’d help us in any way that he could as a volunteer. He is very popular in all circles and everyone would describe him as a gentleman.”

On Monday, his former principal Linda Dunne said that, during his time at Coláiste Bhride, Carnew, Finlay was a reliable, hard-working young man who “always got things done and was willing to help out”. She said Finlay was pivotal in the school achieving an amber award for mental health and everyone could see the leadership potential he held.

""Finlay would have been instrumental in that and was very generous with his time and you don’t get very many young people who are like that with volunteerism,” she said.

Tributes have been pouring in online and neighbour to the Power family, Cllr Anthony Donohoe, sent his sympathies to the family.

""My deepest sympathies go out to the Power family on the loss of their son Finlay following this tragic incident. There is a deep sense of sadness in the Annagh and Hollyfort areas as a dark cloud hangs over the area.

169,Mystery of 'stolen' North West aircraft parts solved,"The plane parts that were impounded in Mahikeng earlier this week have been released to their owner.

Police and the provincial government say the parts were being repaired at the local airport.

The parts were transported in three trucks.

North West police say they have solved the mystery of three trucks found transporting aircraft parts earlier this week.



After days of investigation, the police and provincial government have determined that the parts were at the GD Montshioa Airport in Mmabatho for repairs, and had not been stolen as many had suspected.

On Tuesday, police in the Mahikeng impounded three trucks when residents raised the alarm after they saw them transporting the parts. Suspicion was that the parts had been stolen.

The trucks had already left Mahikeng when they were intercepted and forced to turn back by the police.

Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Adele Myburgh revealed that, since impounding the trucks, they had discovered who the owner was.

""At first, it seemed suspicious because of how they were driving. That's why we impounded them. But we have managed to determine ownership and, because it is not stolen property, we had to release it.""

'Nothing sinister'

Myburgh said investigations had determined that the parts had been brought to Mahikeng for repairs.

""They (the trucks) were transporting the parts back to their owner after repairs. There was nothing sinister about it, but we just had to be sure.""

The North West government corroborated the police's version of events, and said the parts were being transported from Mahikeng to Emalahleni in Mpumalanga.

The provincial community safety and transport management department said the aircraft parts were scrap metal from planes. It added that they belonged to Anton Grungleigh.

""Mr Grungleigh has for many years been operating the Aircraft Maintenance Organisation at the airport. The company owning the aircraft ostensibly being stolen has decided to relocate to Upington from Mafikeng, and thus transported his properties in trucks from the airport,"" said MEC Sello Lehari.

170,Hushed up: Mzwandile Masina's high speed crash in 'borrowed' blue light car,"A high-speed, midnight road accident involving City of Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina has been quietly hushed up.

Masina was at the wheel of a ""blue light"" VIP vehicle he allegedly had no permission to drive. Metro police were told he behaved as if drunk.

Thirteen months later, investigations have stalled and witnesses warned not to talk to the media about the incident.

Shortly after midnight on 20 August last year, a large goods truck driving down the N12 West highway near Alberton was struck from behind by a black BMW 540i, said to have been driven at high speed.

It was not a serious accident: no one was hurt, the truck was undamaged and the car was scraped along the passenger side, with the mirror broken.

But what turned a minor fender-bender into a political mystery is what unfolded next, as described in written statement from a witness and metro police, and in interviews with amaBhungane.

The BMW was driven by mayor Mzwandile Masina, breaking curfew in a City-owned car he had allegedly used without permission. He was removed from the scene before police investigations had finished and no witness statement was taken from him.

The truck driver, who has asked not to be named, told amaBhungane that he was driving an articulated truck, owned by SF Logistics.



Close to the turnoffs to the N12 and N3, he and his assistant in the passenger seat noticed in their rear-view mirrors that a car had appeared behind them, driving at high speed and swinging across lanes.



""Then I heard a bump and noticed a BMW next to my back tyre on my side.""

He slowed the truck, stopped it and got out. Two more cars stopped behind them, with men climbing out and shouting, ""Mayor, are you alright?""

Masina's wife

They then approached the truck driver, ""saying that I had hit the mayor and they were aggressive. The driver (Masina) approached and he was shouting at me, and people stopped him.""

As the heated confrontation continued, a woman appeared and identified herself to the truck driver as Masina's wife.

""She was very understanding when I explained what had happened and she took him away.""

By now, according to a witness, the scene bore no resemblance to a minor accident, with a number of metro police vehicles arriving, as well as the mayor's VIP protection entourage.

A metro policeman questioned both drivers and recorded a brief summary in an accident report, each driver blaming the other.

""Driver A (the truck driver) alleged he was travelling in the 2nd lane direction west when Vehicle ""B"" drive into him from the left side (illegible). Driver of Vehicle B (Masina) alleged he was driving west on N12 in the middle lane when Driver of Vehicle ""A"" come over to his lane and collided with him. The Driver of Vehicle ""A drive on and he manage to stop him.""

AmaBhungane asked the truck driver whether it was true that he failed to stop after the accident. He said that a heavily-laden goods truck could not be instantly stopped, but that he had slowed it down and stopped further up the road. A second officer arrived at the scene at 00:50.

By then, Masina had departed, and only the truck driver was present. The truck driver provided a sworn statement in which he made an additional allegation: ""Immediately I hear a sound, he bumped my tyre of my back trailer and I noticed he was drug [drunk].""

There is no equivalent sworn statement from Masina in the accident report file. The accident report says drunken driving was not suspected, nor was it tested for.

At 08:30 that morning, a more senior officer, Superintendent Kelobogile Thepa, was told about the accident. She discovered that the BMW did not belong to Masina, but was a ""blue light"" VIP vehicle allocated to the office of the mayor. Thepa was head of the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) VIP protection unit at the time.



In a sworn statement attached to the investigations report, she said that after she found out that the mayor was driving an EMPD VIP vehicle, she notified the chief of police and requested him to intervene.

""He (chief of police) requested a meeting with the mayor where he explained processes of vehicle policy within the EMPD and asked if the mayor was aware that an EMPD vehicle was operated with a valid driving authorisation.

""The mayor expressed lack of knowledge with policies of the EMPD and promised never to operate an EMPD allocated vehicle as he is allocated officers for protection and conveyance.""

More questions than answers

In the 13 months since the accident, no further investigations have occurred. The official position is that it was a minor accident warranting no further examination. But a number of aspects certainly appear to deserve further attention:

Why was Masina allowed to leave the scene of an accident still under investigation?

Why did police not question or record why he was on the road at that hour during a curfew?

Why was he driving an EMPD car without permission?

Why was possible intoxication not investigated when the truck driver explicitly accused Masina of being drunk?

amaBhungane spoke to several people, who were either on the scene or were familiar with the investigation. No one would speak on the record, either because they were not authorised to speak to the media, or because they had been warned ""not to say anything relating to the incident ever again"".



Said one person: ""How can you investigate your boss objectively, a person who can make your life at work a misery. The reality is that there is a lot of intimidation happening at Ekurhuleni.""

Said another: ""The mayor has several personal cars. Why did he take this particular blue light car meant for police officers in the middle of the night? You need a permit to drive a car assigned to police. Is this not an abuse of state resources? When the accident happened, the mayor called his VIP entourage immediately and other senior EMPD officers, and yet this was a minor accident and straightforward.""

Mayor's office responds

The mayor's spokesperson, Phakamile Mbengashe, provided an explanation as to why the mayor was on the road during a curfew.

""On the evening of 20 August 2020, the executive mayor had just concluded a series of service delivery oversight visits in Vosloorus when he was notified of a medical emergency concerning a close family relative in Katlehong, which he urgently attended to. The family member subsequently passed away on the same day, 20 August 2020.""

Mbengashe provided a death certificate of the person showing she did indeed die on 20 August 2020.

The reason Masina was driving the VIP protection car himself was that: ""At the time of receiving the notification of the medical emergency, the executive mayor's protection unit had already completed their shift, and they were no longer in the company of the executive mayor.""

He claimed there was no intervention by the chief of police: ""All EMPD processes were followed in accordance with the department's policies.""

Mbengashe said the South African Local Government Association mayoral handbook, Section 5.1.3.1, dealing with terms for the use of official vehicles, leaves it to the discretion of the mayor to utilise a car at the expense of the municipality for any reasonable purpose.

Sharon Seretlo/Gallo Images

However, this section deals with a specific vehicle allocated for exclusive mayoral use, including for personal purposes, whereas it is not clear that the same provision applies to VIP protection vehicles assigned to the mayor's office.



Section 5.1.3.7 notes that: ""The use of any other municipal vehicle by the mayor is not permissible.""

Mbengashe said damage to the car had been minimal, isolated to only a rear mirror, and the mayor had covered the cost of the damage in his personal capacity.

However, pictures from the accident report show not only a broken mirror, but a long gash on the passenger side, running across both front and back doors.

If Masina blames the truck driver for the damage, why would he choose to pay for panel beating out of his own pocket?","['high', 'hushed', 'mayor', 'borrowed', 'driver', 'crash', 'masina', 'driving', 'blue', 'speed', 'car', 'mzwandile', 'empd', 'masinas', 'truck', 'light', 'vehicle', 'vip', 'accident']","Masina was at the wheel of a ""blue light"" VIP vehicle he allegedly had no permission to drive.
The truck driver, who has asked not to be named, told amaBhungane that he was driving an articulated truck, owned by SF Logistics.

171,Alleged cybercrime: FG to arraign activist on Adoke’s complaint,"The Federal Government has filed criminal charges against a civil rights activist and chairman of the Human and Environmental Development Resources Centre, Lanre Suraj, at the Federal High Court in Abuja over allegations that he circulated the audio of a stage-managed phone interview with a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke.

According to TheCable, Suraj was also accused of circulating an allegedly forged email attributed to Adoke in which he was said to have communicated with JP Morgan over the OPL 245 transaction in 2011.

The government in the charges also accused Suraj of committing cybercrime.

No date has been fixed for Suraju’s arraignment in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CR/370/2021 and dated October 8, 2021.

Adoke had petitioned the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, over the circulation of the audio and email, which he said were forged to implicate him in the OPL 245 trial in Milan, Italy.

The Italian court has since dismissed allegations of corruption in the OPL 245 deal while the prosecutors are being investigated over alleged falsification and manipulation of evidence.

Tanker drivers begin strike Monday to protest bad roads

Petroleum tanker drivers will commence a strike on Monday over the deplorable state of the nation’s highways and other issues.

This was revealed by the South-West Zonal Chairman of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, Mr Tayo Aboyeji, on Saturday.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the union has lost many lives and properties due to bad roads.

Aboyeji said that all tanker drivers from the union would withdraw their services nationwide.

He said, “This is not the first time that we will signify our intention to go on strike but we have to call it off because it will generally affect the majority of Nigerians but now our hands are tied.

“We are going on nationwide strike because of the deplorable and shameful state of our highways.

“When a truck loads petrol in Lagos, the drivers spend five to six days to get to Abuja because of the shameful state of the roads.

“All calls by the executive of the petroleum unions have fallen on the deaf ears of the government as the highways continue to deteriorate nationwide.

“The increasing rate of fire incidences involving petroleum tankers with accompanying massive destruction of lives and properties of our members and the general public is enough.

“This is because of the government’s failure to enforce installation of safety gadgets on tankers.

This will protect the inflammatory contents of their trucks from spilling over in a situation of road accident.

“We see the failure of the government in this regard as height of insensitivity to the lives of innocent Nigerians and the union cannot continue to hold its hands while our members are getting burnt everywhere and every day,” he said.

173,"‘Titane’ is a Twisted Exploration of Gender, Violence and Metal","Julia Ducournau’s Titane drips with blood and brake fluid, and mixes milk with motor oil. It centers, in its exacting crosshairs, the fragility of the flesh, the performance of gender, and palpable bodily anxieties, all while telling a bizarre story about a woman who fucks—and is impregnated by—a vintage Cadillac, before going on a murder spree and impersonating the long-lost son of a steroid-loving fire chief. Ducournau and cinematographer Ruben Impens capture all of this with a suitably madcap verve, painting gory violence with tongue-in-cheek whimsy, while zeroing in on the emotional core of operatic moments with laser precision. The result is a wildly visceral experience about transformation, one that lingers beneath the skin.

As a child, young Alexia (Adèle Guigue) has a fixation with cars. When her loud impression of an engine distracts her short-tempered father, she causes a road accident, resulting in a large chunk of her skull being replaced with titanium. Fast forward several years, and the adult Alexia (Agathe Rousselle) has become a famous dancer, whose provocative routine involves straddling the hood of a flaming Cadillac. Even before plunging its way into mind-boggling oddities, the film weaves together two male fetish objects—the car and the feminine form—but after briefly impersonating the male gaze, the camera swiftly ejects it from its purview, as Alexia respond to unwanted sexual advances with stark, discomforting violence.

Titane ★★★★

(4/4 stars)

Directed by: Julia Ducournau

Written by: Julia Ducournau

Starring: Agathe Rousselle, Vincent Lindon, Garance Marillier

Running time: 108 mins.

The violence in Titane is specifically penetrative, with hair sticks and chair legs thrust into ears and mouths. While this both subverts and strongly resembles sexual violence, Alexia’s bodily proximity to motor vehicles ensures that it also calls to mind car keys being twisted in ignitions. After all, one of these violent reprisals leads to her being revved up enough to have sex inside—and with—her vintage car, as it bounces up and down. The anatomical specifics are left out of frame; they don’t matter nearly as much as the glowing image of Alexia’s dripping sweat, or the velvet ropes she grasps, or the scene’s phantasmagorical ecstasy.

This is merely the beginning of the film’s physical, psychological and aesthetic overlap between (wo)man and machine. Alexia’s transhumanistic voyage was quite literally planted in her head in a moment of adolescent trauma, and it now resurges at a catalytic intersection of sex and violence. Her body keeps score during her unexpected pregnancy, during which she bleeds not blood, but a black, motor grease-like substance, and during which her womb becomes laced with metal, inviting questions of what parts of herself she might end up passing down to her child.

Alexia’s pregnancy anxiety also coincides with her evading the law by changing her appearance, in ways both as simple as shaving her eyebrows, and as complicated as breaking and misshaping her nose. She soon takes up residence with a lonely firefighter, Vincent (Vincent Lindon), a sad-clown patriarch past his prime, who pumps iron, and whose stoic rejection of grief primes him to accept, and believe, that Alexia is his long-lost son Adrien. Now living as a twenty-something man, Alexia binds her breasts and her pregnant belly, leading to winding scars akin to an ornate car decal, and to an uneasy balancing act. Not only must she put on a masculine performance—after years of performing her femininity for male eyes—but she must also work at a fire station drenched in homophobia and testosterone, while living with a new father figure whose love is both constrained and overbearing, and who eschews emotional expression in favour of physical dominance.

Alexia’s new predicament turns Titane into a transgender parable, not only because of the literal presence of binding and her need to “pass” as a man (which is directly threatened by her pregnancy), but because of how the film’s more inexplicable bodily anxieties are expressed. The specter of Alexia’s bodily mechanization causes her a dysphoric imbalance. It looms over her in a manner that prevents her from feeling wholly masculine or wholly feminine, two warring, binary modes of physical expression to which she is ultimately drawn, and which coalesce inside her in shocking and confusing ways, as the film blurs the lines between our gendered social understanding of pregnancy and technology—of feminine flesh and masculine metal.

This complicated dichotomy arises as early as Titane’s introductory scenes. High-contrast closeups of car parts dripping motor fluid are color timed to resemble festering wounds—these are also placed in close proximity to similar shots of Alexia on the operating table, with blood dripping from her new titanium skull. The film frequently invites aesthetic comparisons between the circulatory systems of human bodies and motorized creations; as Alexia’s story wears on, this visual overlap becomes more pronounced, especially as Ducournau slowly but surely maps it onto more specific car parts, and more specific body parts as well.

The film’s approach to gender and transformation bears resemblance to Isabel Fall’s unfairly maligned “I Sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter,” a piercing sci-fi short story that explores transgender anxieties through a similar lens. The two texts were likely created independently of one another (the short story has been unavailable for some time), but they make for a fascinating pairing. Each one powerfully unsettles its audience, not only by placing gender’s social function under a microscope in a charged and violent setting, but by using vehicular bodies to magnify gender’s fragile and fluid relationship to the tangible and the physical.

This relationship is often expressed through motion—a fitting extension of the film’s vehicular themes—whether through Alexia’s hasty scrambles to cover up her body and her wounds, or through the contrast between her constrained stillness as the stone-faced Adrien and her eventual return to provocative dance movements to re-assert and re-ignite her femininity. She isn’t the only character to be framed this way; several young firemen are caught in a similar bodily battle. Pulsating musical frolic during nighttime celebrations offers them honest (if momentary) liberation, which clashes with their daytime routines involving their centered, masculine facades. Perhaps most moving of all is the way Vincent fits this mold, as a man torn between his steroid-fueled workouts—which he uses to suppress his emotions and reinforce his denial—and his submission to rhythmic intoxication, his soul set ablaze by a wash of neon light. It may not be long before Titane is programmed as a double feature alongside Beau Travail.

Throughout these physical and emotional transformations, Agathe Rousselle and Vincent Lindon throw themselves into their parts with full force. However, to discuss each role separately would be a purely logistical examination of an emotional whole, of which they form to two inextricable halves. As Alexia/Adrien and Fire Captain Vincent, they portray a remarkable balance between nigh-impenetrable emotional exteriors, and fleeting glimmers of vulnerable longing, for someone who truly understands them—their bodies, and their souls—a desire which Ducournau punctuates in the form of gorgeously detailed character portraits, often filmed in slow motion, amidst a sea of frenzy in an otherwise crowded frame.

Alexia and Vincent’s dynamic isn’t quite as simple as a man and a woman who gradually meet in the middle of a spectrum, but their respective self-actualizations are dependent on one another in unexpected ways. This paves the path for a relationship that starts out absurd, walks a fine line between surreal and familiar—including one particularly side-splitting use of “Macarena”—but soon gives way to complex intimacy, to surprising gentleness, and ultimately, to a stunning emotional crescendo that brings each of the film’s lofty themes full circle.

Strange, frequently haunting, occasionally hilarious and ultimately masterful, Titane is a journey whose head-spinning complications are a vital part of its emotional impact. Wrapping one’s mind around its outlandish elements demands actively re-calibrating cinematic expectations—and in the process, opening the mind and body to more introspective responses to the film’s most visceral, most nauseating and most thrilling scenes.

174,Threatened Swedish Mohammed cartoon artist and two police officers killed in road accident,"THE SWEDISH ARTIST Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Mohammed with a dog’s body brought death threats, has died in a road crash.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were travelling.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist’s partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Mohammed drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle.

He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

176,Swedish artist threatened for Muhammad sketch dies in crash,"Police say Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, has died in a traffic accident

STOCKHOLM -- Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since making a sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body in 2007, died in a weekend crash along with two police bodyguards, police said Monday. He was 75.

Vilks and two plainclothes police officers were killed in a head-on crash with a truck on Sunday afternoon, said Carina Persson, police chief for southern Sweden. All three died on the spot. The 45-year-old truck driver was flown to a hospital with serious injuries.

Persson said the police car, which had left Stockholm and was heading south, veered into the path of the truck and both vehicles burst into flames. The accident occurred near Markaryd, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Malmo, Sweden’s third largest city.

“There is nothing else for now that indicates that it was something else but a traffic accident,” Persson told a press conference.

Sweden’s top police chief, Anders Thornberg, said an investigation would take place, but was expected “to take a relatively long time.”

Sweden’s Culture Minister Amanda Lind called called it “an extremely tragic traffic accident.”

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before 2007, when he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Al-Qaida put a bounty on Vilks’ head. In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden.

Since that time Vilks was forced to live under police protection. As Lind put it Monday, “due to the fact that he made use of his freedom of expression and his artistic freedom.""

Over the years he continued to face threats to his life.

In 2014, a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to kill him.

The following year, a free-speech seminar that Vilks attended in Copenhagen, Denmark, was attacked by a lone gunman who killed a Danish film director and wounded three police officers.

Vilks, who was widely believed to have been the intended target of that 2015 attack, was whisked away unharmed by bodyguards. The gunman later killed a Jewish security guard outside a synagogue and wounded two more officers before he was killed in a firefight with police.

Police said Monday they did not know why the car drove into the wrong lane but they were investigating whether a tire might have exploded. The car transporting Vilks had puncture-proof tires, police said.

The accident happened on the north-south E4 highway Sunday afternoon. The unmarked police car apparently ploughed through a cable guardrail separating the north and south-bound lanes, senior police officer Stefan Siteus said at the news conference.

“We have found residues of tire on the E4 before the accident, and we are looking into the possibility that there could have been some kind of tire explosion,” Siteus said.

The vehicle weighed 4.5 tons, which could explain how the vehicle could drive through a cable guardrail, Siteus said. He added that the speed limit at the site was was 110 kilometers per hour (68 miles per hour). An ordinary large vehicle weighs less than 2 tons.

Born in 1946 in Helsingborg, in southern Sweden, Vilks worked as an artist for almost four decades, and rose to fame for challenging the boundaries of art through several controversial works.

His most famous pieces included “Nimis” — a sculpture of driftwood built without permission in Sweden’s Kullaberg nature reserve — as well as Prophet Muhammad drawings, including the one that showed the prophet as a dog.

Vilks initially planned to display the drawing at an exhibit at a Swedish cultural heritage center, but the drawing was removed over security concerns.

It went largely unnoticed until a Swedish newspaper printed the drawing with an editorial defending freedom of expression.

Several of his works, including driftwood sculptures and Mohammad drawings, including the one showing the Muslim prophet's head on the body of a dog, are currently on display in Warsaw, Poland. The works are being shown as part an exhibition curated by a right-wing director which aims to challenge left-wing political correctness.

STOCKHOLM -- The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

179,Dr Karl Covid-19 Australia: Scientist reveals what would happen if you drank vaccine,"Popular scientist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki has revealed what would happen if a person drank a Covid-19 vaccine instead of injecting it into the arm.

Dr Karl, who is dubbed 'the people's scientist', revealed stomach acid would likely destroy a Covid vaccine ingested via the mouth.

'[The vaccine] is optimised to work by a tiny amount of it being injected into the muscle and then various things happen there,' he explained during an interview on Triple M's The Danny Lakey Show.

'The vitamin is not that much, it's less than a mil, so I'm guessing on average, you could swallow it into your mouth, no worries, and it would go down into your esophagus, no worries.

'In the stomach, the extreme acidity may very well break it down and destroy it.'

Dr Karl Kruszelnicki said stomach acid would likely destroy a Covid vaccine if swallowed

Dr Karl, 73, said that while there are vaccines that are swallowed, including for polio, the health industry was moving towards vaccines administered via a spray.

'We're now moving to vaccines that work where the centre of all the action is, the lungs,' he said.

Host Lakey asked whether the vaccine would taste like medicine.

'It's only a mil, half a mil, so it would depend on the individual vaccine because there's so many,' Dr Karl said.

While a human being's stomach acid, enzymes and gut bacteria generally kill vaccine antigens, ingestible vaccines for diseases such as polio and rotavirus exist because both of those are gut pathogens.

Instructions on Covid-19 vaccines stress they should be administered intramuscularly (above) and not swallowed

It comes after the beloved science boffin took to TikTok to share an important message about the risk of dying from a Covid-19 vaccine compared to the disease itself.

'One in a million is the odds of dying from the AstraZeneca vaccine,' the expert said.

The figure is taken from Therapeutic Goods Administration data, which shows there have only been nine deaths linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine from more than 9.6 million doses administered across Australia as of August 29.

The vaccine has been linked to extremely rare blood clotting incidents but Dr Karl said the risk of dying in a road accident is still much higher at 40 deaths in a million.

He said the chance of dying from Covid-19 once infected is 22,000 in a million, 550 times higher than the risk of being killed on Australia's roads.

'22,000 to one. Those are really good odds,' Dr Karl said. 'That's why I got vaccinated as soon as possible - and so should you.'

During Melbourne's Covid-19 second wave there were 18,628 cases and 800 deaths as the virus ripped through Victoria's unvaccinated population in late 2020, according to the state's Department of Health.

Those figures equal a death rate of 42,000 in a million.","['happen', 'scientist', 'vaccine', 'million', 'mil', 'stomach', 'covid19', 'dying', 'dr', 'risk', 'australia', 'reveals', 'vaccines', 'karl', 'drank']","Popular scientist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki has revealed what would happen if a person drank a Covid-19 vaccine instead of injecting it into the arm.

180,Attorney sentenced for stealing R1.4 million in Road Accident Fund payouts meant for his clients,"An Eastern Cape attorney has been handed a suspended sentence of two years for stealing R1.4 million from his clients.

Sonwabo Archibald Hermanus, 55, was ordered to pay back the R1.4 million stolen over a period of five years.

The sentence is wholly suspended for five years, provided that he does not commit the same offence during the suspension period.

An Eastern Cape attorney has been sentenced to two years imprisonment for stealing R1.4 million in Road Accident Fund (RAF) payouts made to his clients.



Sonwabo Archibald Hermanus' sentence was wholly suspended for five years, provided that he does not commit the same offence during the suspension period.

The Mthatha Serious Commercial Specialised Crime Court also ordered Hermanus, 55, to pay back the R1.4 million over a period of five years.

The Hawks said the R1.4 million was deposited by the RAF into Hermanus' trust account in 2013.

The money was meant for Hermanus' clients.

A former attorney from Gauteng has appeared in court for allegedly stealing R1.2 million from a trust fund.

Ramolongwane Patrick Mariri, 48, appeared in the Pretoria Specialised Commercial Crimes Court on Friday on charges of theft, said Hawks spokesperson Captain Ndivhuwo Mulamu.

The incident allegedly took place in 2017 when Mariri was employed at a Pretoria law firm.

""It is alleged that during 2017, when Mariri was practising as an attorney at RP Mariri Attorneys in Pretoria, he swindled and withdrew over R1.2 million from the attorney's trust fund for personal use,"" said Mulamu.

The funds were linked to a Road Accident Fund payment, Mulamu added.

Mulamu said:

Further investigation revealed that the money was paid into the trust fund account following the Road Accident Fund clients' payment finalisation. The Law Society…struck Mariri off the roll of practicing attorneys in 2017.

A warrant of arrest was issued, and Mariri handed himself over at the Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation office in Pretoria on Thursday.



""The investigation team formally charged him with theft and took him to court,"" said Mulamu.

Mariri was granted R10 000 bail, and the case was postponed to 22 October 2021 for further investigation.

A council sitting will take place on Friday when Moerane is expected to be elected uncontested.

He is poised to replace the late Jolidee Matongo, who died in a car accident two months after taking up the post.

Johannesburg MMC for Environment and Infrastructure Services Mpho Moerane has been endorsed by the ANC's Johannesburg regional executive committee as the party's candidate for City of Johannesburg mayor.

News24 understands that Moerane was ""unanimously"" endorsed at committee meeting on Tuesday after the committee received advice from the legal teams of the Johannesburg ANC and provincial Cogta department.

The committee sought the legal opinion shortly after former mayor Jolidee Matongo died in a road accident two months after taking the post. Matongo was among the longest-serving members of the committee and was previously appointed by late mayor Geoff Makhubo to serve as the City of Johannesburg's MMC for Finance.

183,Dignity for disabled people: They put my little brother in an old people's home... aged 26,"My little brother Omar has always been fearless, pretty much. I'm two years older, but when we were children he was always the first to climb a tree or jump a fence.

I still call him my little brother – but by the time he was in his 20s he was 6ft 1in, with a 14-stone muscular frame who had trained in the British Army. He became a bit of a local hero, too.

He once came to the rescue of a woman who was being robbed at knifepoint – chasing her assailant away.

Yet today, at the age of 33, following a devastating road accident, he faces spending the rest of his life consigned to an old people's home, alongside dementia patients in their 80s.

Eight years ago, Omar's motorbike skidded over a manhole cover, and he was catapulted into a lamp post then a telephone box.

He sustained 27 bone fractures, severed nerves in the neck, arm and back, dislocated his skull from his spine, became deaf in one ear and suffered four brain haemorrhages.

Omar Moustapha , now 33, with his sister, Mariam. Eight years ago, his motorbike skidded over a manhole cover, and he was catapulted into a lamp post then a telephone box. He sustained 27 bone fractures, severed nerves in the neck, arm and back, dislocated his skull from his spine, became deaf in one ear and suffered four brain haemorrhages

He wasn't expected to wake up from a coma, which lasted for a fortnight – but he did.

He spent 16 months in hospital where he had 30 operations, as well as multiple psychiatric assessments as the brain damage has left him with long-term mental health problems.

Omar, my heroic brother, has made remarkable steps to recovery – yet he can't walk longer than a few metres unaided and needs help to wash, dress and do other day-to-day things.

Damage to the nerves in his throat mean he is vulnerable to spasms when eating and drinking, so needs help to prevent him from choking. We've had inadequate help from local healthcare teams, so he is now reliant on our mother, who is 64, and 35-year-old me.

My family has tried everything to get the care Omar desperately needs to live as independently as possible. Ealing Council, in West London, made this impossible from the beginning.

Every request was met with push back. We've written to our MP, James Murray, submitted reports by GPs, surgeons and psychiatrists to support the case for extra help – to no avail.

Mariam pictured with Omar on a night out in 2009. 'My family has tried everything to get the care Omar desperately needs to live as independently as possible. Ealing Council, in West London, made this impossible from the beginning,' says Mariam

The council's only suggestion is for him to go into an old people's home, because specialist services for disabled younger people are so scarce. It's not something he wants to do, not least because he was previously put in one and he felt so desperate he tried to take his own life.

Just over two years ago, The Mail on Sunday revealed that thousands of young Britons with disabilities were languishing in nursing homes.

One woman, 46-year-old Nina Thair, an assistant headteacher from Brighton, was placed in a nursing home for dementia patients when a multiple sclerosis relapse left her unable to live independently. The local council refused to pay the fees – leaving Nina to foot the £4,800 monthly bill.

That shocking story marked the launch of The Mail on Sunday's Dignity For Disabled People campaign, in which we highlighted shocking injustices dealt to some of the most vulnerable people in our society.

And all the while, the nightmarish situation had been playing out in my own house for the previous five years. Despite my role as one of The Mail on Sunday's fitness experts, I haven't written about this until now.

Omar didn't want people to know that he can't cope on his own. But the situation has become so desperate that we have little choice but to speak out.

I hope by doing so people will see that if it can happen to a family like ours, it could happen to anyone.

Omar was just 24 when he became one of the 1.2 million Britons with severe disabilities. I'll never forget the sight of the policeman at the doorstep, and the heart-stopping moment he told us my brother had been airlifted to hospital.

The officer took us to his bedside, while my mother, my younger sister – who has Down's syndrome –and I sat in silence, terrified.

We slept by Omar's bedside for two weeks, preparing for his heart to stop at any moment, while doctors explained that if he did wake up, for the rest of his life he'd be reliant on a wheelchair and an oxygen tank to breathe.

Then came the miraculous moment he began to breathe without a machine – and we realised he might make it after all.

After being discharged from hospital, his care at a rehabilitation centre in Banstead, Surrey, was exemplary. The experts there were teaching him how to, quite literally, get back on his feet.

And it seemed to be working. Having been told he'd never walk again, he'd managed to make it down an entire corridor, picking up one leg at a time using his left arm – the only limb he still has slight feeling in.

It's a fact More than 400,000 wheelchair-users in England live in homes that are deemed inaccessible, claims housing association Habinteg.

The number of disabled people waiting for suitable housing has risen by ten per cent since 2017 to roughly 120,000. Advertisement

But one day the doctor entered his room and told us the local council had cut funding for his care. He had to be out within the week.

Omar had recently split from his wife, with whom he had a two- month-old son and shared a flat, so we had planned that, at some point when he was much better, he'd return to the family home, where my mother and I could look after him. But we weren't ready yet.

His doctors told us our three-bedroom house would need a complete overhaul to meet Omar's needs: railings installed to help him get up and down stairs, a wet room on the ground floor and walls knocked through to create more space. We begged for more time. The answer was no.

Instead, Omar would have to be admitted to the local nursing home, where he'd receive 24-hour care, paid for by the local council.

He was inconsolable, and slumped into a deep depression, repeating 'my life is over,' again and again.

He moved there in late 2015. The elderly man in the room opposite would scream expletives throughout the day and into the night. Many others were dying.

While the rehab team in Surrey had worked hard to get Omar moving again, here, staff did little to help him.

He grew angry, began hitting his head against the walls, throwing objects in frustration and became verbally aggressive.

This behaviour would have left the old Omar mortified – he could be hot-headed, but never, ever threatening. The brain haemorrhages have made him prone to outbursts.

After a few days he phoned our mother, begging us to come and collect him. Back at home, he got even worse.

He could barely balance, as nerve damage to his ankles has made his feet 'lifeless'. Sometimes he resorted to crawling back up the stairs, to be safe.

The council provided a wheelchair, but due to the lack of feeling in his arms he can't use it independently. Splints don't help either, as they cause him pain. Showering became more infrequent – the ordeal of having his mother or sister assist him proved embarrassing.

Terrified of the mountain that was the staircase, he chose to spend most days in his bedroom, increasingly depressed.

According to Government guidance, those with an ongoing healthcare need, such as Omar, qualify for NHS support – but funding and staffing problems mean patients often face delays of several years before accessing essential care and equipment.

A social worker's assessment in 2015 concluded that Omar needed 24-hour assistance and that, given his age and mental health risk, it was important he retained as much independence as possible.

The council agreed to find Omar his own accessible flat in the local area – but even this has been impossible.

Omar is desperate for his own space, away from his mother and sister. Our once enviably close brother-sister relationship is in tatters.

Omar, aged five, and elder sister Mariam playing on go-karts in 1994. She always admired his fearless nature before his accident in 2013

Having to ask his sister to be on hand should he fall when using the toilet is beyond humiliating. And watching me go out to work and enjoy dinners with friends, while his only outing was to the hospital, to have his wounds dressed, has been excruciating.

Omar preferred not to talk to me, or ask for help.

The council suggested sending carers three times a day to help with cleaning, cooking and personal care duties, when my mother and I couldn't manage.

But Omar's brain injury means he is paranoid. He gets aggressive around strangers in his house.

In 2017, the council offered Omar a flat 20 minutes from home – but in the heart of a notorious estate.

At the viewing, we learnt the next-door neighbour had recently been released from prison.

We explained to the council that we didn't feel it would be safe, given my brother's physical and mental vulnerabilities. It also suggested a one-bedroom flat, despite Omar's team of consultants warning against him living alone.

Even when The Mail on Sunday contacted Ealing council to clarify details, they continued to claim he did not require a live-in carer, which made him ineligible for a two-bedroom property.

We've struggled on over the past few years, my mother and I doing alternate shifts, with Omar becoming more and more disengaged with life.

Then, in February last year, while I was out working, he had a bad fall down the stairs and was screaming in pain. In a fury, he dragged himself into my mother's bedroom, grabbed hold of some glass vases on the shelves and smashed them.

Then he attempted suicide in front of her. She called the police, who took him to a psychiatric hospital.

The psychiatrist prescribed antidepressants, and wrote a strongly worded letter to health chiefs in charge of Omar's care, warning of the urgency of his living situation and that he should not be left to live alone.

He came home a few days later, and 18 months on, we're in the same situation. Omar's life has become what he describes as 'a hamster wheel'. 'Every day I wake up, I'm just waiting to go back to sleep. It's killing me inside.'

When our local MP approached the council, asking for a meeting to discuss Omar's case, he was told: 'Sorry, no meetings with politicians at the moment, because of Covid.'

No Zoom meeting, or phone call. Nothing. Meanwhile, Omar's physical condition has taken another dive. In April he underwent another operation on his sciatic nerve, which stretches from the leg to the lower spine.

Ever since, his balance has got worse and he hasn't ventured out of the house in five months, until the end of last week, in the run-up to the publication of this article – which seems to have offered him new hope.

When he found out I'd be writing it, he wasn't thrilled, but agreed because of the comfort he knew it would offer thousands in a similar position. He's made peace with the fact his secret will soon be out. Finally, his voice will be heard.

We can only hope those at the top of the chain are listening.

In a statement, Ealing council said: 'Social housing is in very short supply in Ealing, with more than 11,300 households waiting for a council home.

'We ensure homes go to those who need them most by allocating our finite resources according to priority.

'Mr Moustapha has been in our second-highest priority allocation band since 2016.'

Police and the SPCA are investigating what's been called the ""brutal slaughter"" of 11 rabbits and ducks at an animal shelter in Dairy Flat, Auckland.

Founder of Pixies Animal Rescue Charmain Wolmarans said the rescue animals were killed overnight after a break-in, leaving staff and animals shocked and distressed.

SPCA national inspectorate manager Alan Wilson said the animals appear to have been deliberately killed.

""We are shocked and appalled by this incident, and condemn any senseless act of violence towards defenceless animals,"" he said.

Police confirmed the burglary and said no arrests have been made but inquiries are continuing.

Wolmarans is calling for anyone with information to pass it on to the police or SPCA.

In a Facebook post this morning, she said the shelter needs help to move animals to safety in case there are further attacks. They will not be taking any new animals until the situation is more stable.

Originally from South Africa, Wolmarans started Pixies in 2012 in memory of her daughter who was killed in a road accident at the age of 18.

The animal rescue cares for nearly 400 animals every year.

186,Self-Parking Car in 500 Lines of Code,"Self-Parking Car in 500 Lines of Code

28 September, 2021 15 min to read

In this article, we'll train the car to do self-parking using a genetic algorithm.

We'll create the 1st generation of cars with random genomes that will behave something like this:

On the ≈40th generation the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot:

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

Yeah-yeah, the cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so be merciful and give the cars some space to grow :D

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The genetic algorithm for this project is implemented in TypeScript. The full genetic source code will be shown in this article, but you may also find the final code examples in the Evolution Simulator repository.

We're going to use a genetic algorithm for the particular task of evolving cars' genomes. However, this article only touches on the basics of the algorithm and is by no means a complete guide to the genetic algorithm topic.

Having that said, let's deep dive into more details...

The Plan

Step-by-step we're going to break down a high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 bits (finding the optimal car genome).

Here is what we're going to do:

💪🏻 Give the muscles (engine, steering wheel) to the car so that it could move towards the parking spot. 👀 Give the eyes (sensors) to the car so that it could see the obstacles around. 🧠 Give the brain to the car that will control the muscles (movements) based on what the car sees (obstacles via sensors). The brain will be simply a pure function movements = f(sensors) . 🧬 Evolve the brain to do the right moves based on the sensors input. This is where we will apply a genetic algorithm. Generation after generation our brain function movements = f(sensors) will learn how to move the car towards the parking spot.

Giving the muscles to the car

To be able to move, the car would need ""muscles"". Let's give the car two types of muscles:

Engine muscle - allows the car to move ↓ back, ↑ forth, or ◎ stand steel (neutral gear) Steering wheel muscle - allows the car to turn ← left, → right, or ◎ go straight while moving

With these two muscles the car can perform the following movements:

In our case, the muscles are receivers of the signals that come from the brain once every 100ms (milliseconds). Based on the value of the brain's signal the muscles act differently. We'll cover the ""brain"" part below, but for now, let's say that our brain may send only 3 possible signals to each muscle: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

type MuscleSignal = - 1 | 0 | 1 ;

For example, the brain may send the signal with the value of +1 to the engine muscle and it will start moving the car forward. The signal -1 to the engine moves the car backward. At the same time, if the brain will send the signal of -1 to the steering wheel muscle, it will turn the car to the left, etc.

Here is how the brain signal values map to the muscle actions in our case:

Muscle Signal = -1 Signal = 0 Signal = +1 Engine ↓ Backward ◎ Neutral ↑ Forward Steering wheel ← Left ◎ Straight → Right

You may use the Evolution Simulator and try to park the car manually to see how the car muscles work. Every time you press one of the WASD keyboard keys (or use a touch-screen joystick) you send these -1 , 0 , or +1 signals to the engine and steering wheel muscles.

Giving the eyes to the car

Before our car will learn how to do self-parking using its muscles, it needs to be able to ""see"" the surroundings. Let's give it the 8 eyes in a form of distance sensors:

Each sensor can detect the obstacle in a distance range of 0-4m (meters).

(meters). Each sensor reports the latest information about the obstacles it ""sees"" to the car's ""brain"" every 100ms .

. Whenever the sensor doesn't see any obstacles it reports the value of 0 . On the contrary, if the value of the sensor is small but not zero (i.e. 0.01m ) it would mean that the obstacle is close.

You may use the Evolution Simulator and see how the color of each sensor changes based on how close the obstacle is.

type Sensors = number [ ] ;

Giving the brain to the car

At this moment, our car can ""see"" and ""move"", but there is no ""coordinator"", that would transform the signals from the ""eyes"" to the proper movements of the ""muscles"". We need to give the car a ""brain"".

Brain input

As an input from the sensors, every 100ms the brain will be getting 8 float numbers, each one in range of [0...4] . For example, the input might look like this:

const sensors : Sensors = [ s0 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 , s7 ] ;

Brain output

Every 100ms the brain should produce two integers as an output:

One number as a signal for the engine: engineSignal One number as a signal for the steering wheel: wheelSignal

Each number should be of the type MuscleSignal and might take one of three values: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

Brain formulas/functions

Keeping in mind the brain's input and output mentioned above we may say that the brain is just a function:

const { engineSignal , wheelSignal } = brainToMuscleSignal ( brainFunction ( sensors ) ) ;

Where brainToMuscleSignal() is a function that converts raw brain signals (any float number) to muscle signals (to -1 , 0 , or +1 number) so that muscles could understand it. We'll implement this converter function below.

The main question now is what kind of a function the brainFunction() is.

To make the car smarter and its movements to be more sophisticated we could go with a Multilayer Perceptron. The name is a bit scary but this is a simple Neural Network with a basic architecture (think of it as a big formula with many parameters/coefficients).

I've covered Multilayer Perceptrons with a bit more details in my homemade-machine-learning, machine-learning-experiments, and nano-neuron projects. You may even challenge that simple network to recognize your written digits.

However, to avoid the introduction of a whole new concept of Neural Networks, we'll go with a much simpler approach and we'll use two Linear Polynomials with multiple variables (to be more precise, each polynomial will have exactly 8 variables, since we have 8 sensors) which will look something like this:

engineSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( e0 * s0 ) + ( e1 * s1 ) + ... + ( e7 * s7 ) + e8 ) wheelSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( w0 * s0 ) + ( w1 * s1 ) + ... + ( w7 * s7 ) + w8 )

Where:

[s0, s1, ..., s7] - the 8 variables, which are the 8 sensor values. These are dynamic.

- the variables, which are the sensor values. These are dynamic. [e0, e1, ..., e8] - the 9 coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static.

- the coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static. [w0, w1, ..., w8] - the 9 coefficients for the steering wheel polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static

The cost of using the simpler function for the brain will be that the car won't be able to learn some sophisticated moves and also won't be able to generalize well and adapt well to unknown surroundings. But for our particular parking lot and for the sake of demonstrating the work of a genetic algorithm it should still be enough.

We may implement the generic polynomial function in the following way:

type Coefficients = number [ ] ; const linearPolynomial = ( coefficients : Coefficients , variables : number [ ] ) : number => { if ( coefficients . length !== ( variables . length + 1 ) ) { throw new Error ( 'Incompatible number of polynomial coefficients and variables' ) ; } let result = 0 ; coefficients . forEach ( ( coefficient : number , coefficientIndex : number ) => { if ( coefficientIndex < variables . length ) { result += coefficient * variables [ coefficientIndex ] ; } else { result += coefficient } } ) ; return result ; } ;

The car's brain in this case will consist of two polynomials and will look like this:

const engineSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( engineCoefficients , sensors ) ) ; const wheelSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( wheelCoefficients , sensors ) ) ;

The output of a linearPolynomial() function is a float number. The brainToMuscleSignal() function need to convert the wide range of floats to three particular integers, and it will do it in two steps:

Convert the float of a wide range (i.e. 0.456 or 3673.45 or -280 ) to the float in a range of (0...1) (i.e. 0.05 or 0.86 ) Convert the float in a range of (0...1) to one of three integer values of -1 , 0 , or +1 . For example, the floats that are close to 0 will be converted to -1 , the floats that are close to 0.5 will be converted to 0 , and the floats that are close to 1 will be converted to 1 .

To do the first part of the conversion we need to introduce a Sigmoid Function which implements the following formula:

It converts the wide range of floats (the x axis) to float numbers with a limited range of (0...1) (the y axis). This is exactly what we need.

Here is how the conversion steps would look on the Sigmoid graph.

The implementation of two conversion steps mentioned above would look like this:

const sigmoid = ( x : number ) : number => { return 1 / ( 1 + Math . E ** - x ) ; } ; const sigmoidToMuscleSignal = ( sigmoidValue : number , margin : number = 0.4 ) : MuscleSignal => { if ( sigmoidValue < ( 0.5 - margin ) ) { return - 1 ; } if ( sigmoidValue > ( 0.5 + margin ) ) { return 1 ; } return 0 ; } ; const brainToMuscleSignal = ( rawBrainSignal : number ) : MuscleSignal => { const normalizedBrainSignal = sigmoid ( rawBrainSignal ) ; return sigmoidToMuscleSignal ( normalizedBrainSignal ) ; }

Car's genome (DNA)

☝🏻 The main conclusion from the ""Eyes"", ""Muscles"" and ""Brain"" sections above should be this: the coefficients [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] defines the behavior of the car. These 18 numbers together form the unique car's Genome (or car's DNA).

Car genome in a decimal form

Let's join the [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] brain coefficients together to form a car's genome in a decimal form:

const carGenomeBase10 = [ e0 , e1 , ... , e8 , w0 , w1 , ... , w8 ] ;

Car genome in a binary form

Let's move one step deeper (to the level of the genes) and convert the decimal numbers of the car's genome to the binary format (to the plain 1 s and 0 s).

I've described in the detail the process of converting the floating-point numbers to binary numbers in the Binary representation of the floating-point numbers article. You might want to check it out if the code in this section is not clear.

Here is a quick example of how the floating-point number may be converted to the 16 bits binary number (again, feel free to read this first if the example is confusing):

In our case, to reduce the genome length, we will convert each floating coefficient to the non-standard 10 bits binary number ( 1 sign bit, 4 exponent bits, 5 fraction bits).

We have 18 coefficients in total, every coefficient will be converted to 10 bits number. It means that the car's genome will be an array of 0 s and 1 s with a length of 18 * 10 = 180 bits .

For example, for the genome in a decimal format that was mentioned above, its binary representation would look like this:

type Gene = 0 | 1 ; type Genome = Gene [ ] ; const genome : Genome = [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , ] ;

Oh my! The binary genome looks so cryptic. But can you imagine, that these 180 zeroes and ones alone define how the car behaves in the parking lot! It's like you hacked someone's DNA and know what each gene means exactly. Amazing!

By the way, you may see the exact values of genomes and coefficients for the best performing car on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Here is the source code that performs the conversion from binary to decimal format for the floating-point numbers (the brain will need it to decode the genome and to produce the muscle signals based on the genome data):

type Bit = 0 | 1 ; type Bits = Bit [ ] ; type PrecisionConfig = { signBitsCount : number , exponentBitsCount : number , fractionBitsCount : number , totalBitsCount : number , } ; type PrecisionConfigs = { custom : PrecisionConfig , } ; const precisionConfigs : PrecisionConfigs = { custom : { signBitsCount : 1 , exponentBitsCount : 4 , fractionBitsCount : 5 , totalBitsCount : 10 , } , } ; function bitsToFloat ( bits : Bits , precisionConfig : PrecisionConfig ) : number { const { signBitsCount , exponentBitsCount } = precisionConfig ; const sign = ( - 1 ) ** bits [ 0 ] ; const exponentBias = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - 1 ) - 1 ; const exponentBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount , signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const exponentUnbiased = exponentBits . reduce ( ( exponentSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - bitIndex - 1 ) ; return exponentSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; const exponent = exponentUnbiased - exponentBias ; const fractionBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const fraction = fractionBits . reduce ( ( fractionSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** - ( bitIndex + 1 ) ; return fractionSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; return sign * ( 2 ** exponent ) * ( 1 + fraction ) ; } function bitsToFloat10 ( bits : Bits ) : number { return bitsToFloat ( bits , precisionConfigs . custom ) ; }

Brain function working with binary genome

Previously our brain function was working with the decimal form of engineCoefficients and wheelCoefficients polynomial coefficients directly. However, these coefficients are now encoded in the binary form of a genome. Let's add a decodeGenome() function that will extract coefficients from the genome and let's rewrite our brain functions:

const CAR_SENSORS_NUM = 8 ; const BIAS_UNITS = 1 ; const GENES_PER_NUMBER = precisionConfigs . custom . totalBitsCount ; const ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const GENOME_LENGTH = ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ; type DecodedGenome = { engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , } const genomeToNumbers = ( genome : Genome , genesPerNumber : number ) : number [ ] => { if ( genome . length % genesPerNumber !== 0 ) { throw new Error ( 'Wrong number of genes in the numbers genome' ) ; } const numbers : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let numberIndex = 0 ; numberIndex < genome . length ; numberIndex += genesPerNumber ) { const number : number = bitsToFloat10 ( genome . slice ( numberIndex , numberIndex + genesPerNumber ) ) ; numbers . push ( number ) ; } return numbers ; } ; const decodeGenome = ( genome : Genome ) : DecodedGenome => { const engineGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( 0 , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ) ; const wheelsGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ) ; const engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( engineGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; const wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( wheelsGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; return { engineFormulaCoefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients , } ; } ; export const getEngineMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { engineFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ; export const getWheelsMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { wheelsFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ;

Self-driving car problem statement

☝🏻 So, finally, we've got to the point when the high-level problem of making the car to be a self-parking car is broken down to the straightforward optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeros (finding the ""good enough"" car's genome). Sounds simple, doesn't it?

Naive approach

We could approach the problem of finding the ""good enough"" genome in a naive way and try out all possible combinations of genes:

[0, ..., 0, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 0, 1] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 1] , and then... ...

But, let's do some math. With 180 bits and with each bit being equal either to 0 or to 1 we would have 2^180 (or 1.53 * 10^54 ) possible combinations. Let's say we would need to give 15s to each car to see if it will park successfully or not. Let's also say that we may run a simulation for 10 cars at once. Then we would need 15 * (1.53 * 10^54) / 10 = 2.29 * 10^54 [seconds] which is 7.36 * 10^46 [years] . Pretty long waiting time. Just as a side thought, it is only 2.021 * 10^3 [years] that have passed after Christ was born.

Genetic approach

We need a faster algorithm to find the optimal value of the genome. This is where the genetic algorithm comes to the rescue. We might not find the best value of the genome, but there is a chance that we may find the optimal value of it. And, what is, more importantly, we don't need to wait that long. With the Evolution Simulator I was able to find a pretty good genome within 24 [hours] .

Genetic algorithm basics

A genetic algorithms (GA) inspired by the process of natural selection, and are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as crossover, mutation and selection.

The problem of finding the ""good enough"" combination of genes for the car looks like an optimization problem, so there is a good chance that GA will help us here.

We're not going to cover a genetic algorithm in all details, but on a high level here are the basic steps that we will need to do:

CREATE – the very first generation of cars can't come out of nothing, so we will generate a set of random car genomes (set of binary arrays with the length of 180 ) at the very beginning. For example, we may create ~1000 cars. With a bigger population the chances to find the optimal solution (and to find it faster) increase. SELECT - we will need to select the fittest individuums out of the current generation for further mating (see the next step). The fitness of each individuum will be defined based on the fitness function, which in our case, will show how close the car approached the target parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. MATE – simply saying we will allow the selected ""♂ father-cars"" to have ""sex"" with the selected ""♀ mother-cars"" so that their genomes could mix in a ~50/50 proportion and produce ""♂♀ children-cars"" genomes. The idea is that the children cars might get better (or worse) in self-parking, by taking the best (or the worst) bits from their parents. MUTATE - during the mating process some genes may randomly mutate ( 1 s and 0 s in child genome may flip). This may bring a wider variety of children genomes and, thus, a wider variety of children cars behavior. Imagine that the 1st bit was accidentally set to 0 for all ~1000 cars. The only way to try the car with the 1st bit being set to 1 is through the random mutations. At the same time, extensive mutations may ruin healthy genomes. Go to ""Step 2"" unless the number of generations has reached the limit (i.e. 100 generations have passed) or unless the top-performing individuums have reached the expected fitness function value (i.e. the best car has approached the parking spot closer than 1 meter ). Otherwise, quit.

Evolving the car's brain using a Genetic Algorithm

Before launching the genetic algorithm let's go and create the functions for the ""CREATE"", ""SELECT"", ""MATE"" and ""MUTATE"" steps of the algorithm.

Functions for the CREATE step

The createGeneration() function will create an array of random genomes (a.k.a. population or generation) and will accept two parameters:

generationSize - defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation.

- defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation. genomeLength - defines the genome length of each individuum in the cars population. In our case, the length of the genome will be 180 .

There is a 50/50 chance for each gene of a genome to be either 0 or 1 .

type Generation = Genome [ ] ; type GenerationParams = { generationSize : number , genomeLength : number , } ; function createGenome ( length : number ) : Genome { return new Array ( length ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? 0 : 1 ) ) ; } function createGeneration ( params : GenerationParams ) : Generation { const { generationSize , genomeLength } = params ; return new Array ( generationSize ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => createGenome ( genomeLength ) ) ; }

Functions for the MUTATE step

The mutate() function will mutate some genes randomly based on the mutationProbability value.

For example, if the mutationProbability = 0.1 then there is a 10% chance for each genome to be mutated. Let's say if we would have a genome of length 10 that looks like [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] , then after the mutation, there will be a chance that 1 gene will be mutated and we may get a genome that might look like [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] .

type Probability = number ; function mutate ( genome : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability ) : Genome { for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < genome . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { const gene : Gene = genome [ geneIndex ] ; const mutatedGene : Gene = gene === 0 ? 1 : 0 ; genome [ geneIndex ] = Math . random ( ) < mutationProbability ? mutatedGene : gene ; } return genome ; }

Functions for the MATE step

The mate() function will accept the father and the mother genomes and will produce two children. We will imitate the real-world scenario and also do the mutation during the mating.

Each bit of the child genome will be defined based on the values of the correspondent bit of the father's or mother's genomes. There is a 50/50% probability that the child will inherit the bit of the father or the mother. For example, let's say we have genomes of length 4 (for simplicity reasons):

Father's genome: [0, 0, 1, 1] Mother's genome: [0, 1, 0, 1] ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ Possible kid #1: [0, 1, 1, 1] Possible kid #2: [0, 0, 1, 1]

In the example above the mutation were not taken into account.

Here is the function implementation:

function mate ( father : Genome , mother : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability , ) : [ Genome , Genome ] { if ( father . length !== mother . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Cannot mate different species' ) ; } const firstChild : Genome = [ ] ; const secondChild : Genome = [ ] ; for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < father . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { firstChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; secondChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; } return [ mutate ( firstChild , mutationProbability ) , mutate ( secondChild , mutationProbability ) , ] ; }

Functions for the SELECT step

To select the fittest individuums for further mating we need a way to find out the fitness of each genome. To do this we will use a so-called fitness function.

The fitness function is always related to the particular task that we try to solve, and it is not generic. In our case, the fitness function will measure the distance between the car and the parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. We will implement the fitness function a bit later, but for now, let's introduce the interface for it:

type FitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) => number ;

Now, let's say we have fitness values for each individuum in the population. Let's also say that we sorted all individuums by their fitness values so that the first individuums are the strongest ones. How should we select the fathers and the mothers from this array? We need to do the selection in a way, that the higher the fitness value of the individuum, the higher the chances of this individuum being selected for mating. The weightedRandom() function will help us with this.

const weightedRandom = < T > ( items : T [ ] , weights : number [ ] ) : { item : T , index : number } => { if ( items . length !== weights . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Items and weights must be of the same size' ) ; } const cumulativeWeights : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < weights . length ; i += 1 ) { cumulativeWeights [ i ] = weights [ i ] + ( cumulativeWeights [ i - 1 ] || 0 ) ; } const maxCumulativeWeight = cumulativeWeights [ cumulativeWeights . length - 1 ] ; const randomNumber = maxCumulativeWeight * Math . random ( ) ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < items . length ; i += 1 ) { if ( cumulativeWeights [ i ] >= randomNumber ) { return { item : items [ i ] , index : i , } ; } } return { item : items [ items . length - 1 ] , index : items . length - 1 , } ; } ;

The usage of this function is pretty straightforward. Let's say you really like bananas and want to eat them more often than strawberries. Then you may call const fruit = weightedRandom(['banana', 'strawberry'], [9, 1]) , and in ≈9 out of 10 cases the fruit variable will be equal to banana , and only in ≈1 out of 10 times it will be equal to strawberry .

To avoid losing the best individuums (let's call them champions) during the mating process we may also introduce a so-called longLivingChampionsPercentage parameter. For example, if the longLivingChampionsPercentage = 10 , then 10% of the best cars from the previous population will be carried over to the new generation. You may think about it as there are some long-living individuums that can live a long life and see their children and even grandchildren.

Here is the actual implementation of the select() function:

type Percentage = number ; type SelectionOptions = { mutationProbability : Probability , longLivingChampionsPercentage : Percentage , } ; function select ( generation : Generation , fitness : FitnessFunction , options : SelectionOptions , ) { const { mutationProbability , longLivingChampionsPercentage , } = options ; const newGeneration : Generation = [ ] ; const oldGeneration = [ ... generation ] ; oldGeneration . sort ( ( genomeA : Genome , genomeB : Genome ) : number => { const fitnessA = fitness ( genomeA ) ; const fitnessB = fitness ( genomeB ) ; if ( fitnessA < fitnessB ) { return 1 ; } if ( fitnessA > fitnessB ) { return - 1 ; } return 0 ; } ) ; const longLiversCount = Math . floor ( longLivingChampionsPercentage * oldGeneration . length / 100 ) ; if ( longLiversCount ) { oldGeneration . slice ( 0 , longLiversCount ) . forEach ( ( longLivingGenome : Genome ) => { newGeneration . push ( longLivingGenome ) ; } ) ; } const fitnessPerOldGenome : number [ ] = oldGeneration . map ( ( genome : Genome ) => fitness ( genome ) ) ; while ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { let father : Genome | null = null ; let fatherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; let mother : Genome | null = null ; let matherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; while ( ! father || ! mother || fatherGenomeIndex === matherGenomeIndex ) { const { item : randomFather , index : randomFatherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; const { item : randomMother , index : randomMotherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; father = randomFather ; fatherGenomeIndex = randomFatherGenomeIndex ; mother = randomMother ; matherGenomeIndex = randomMotherGenomeIndex ; } const [ firstChild , secondChild ] = mate ( father , mother , mutationProbability ) ; newGeneration . push ( firstChild ) ; if ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { newGeneration . push ( secondChild ) ; } } return newGeneration ; }

Fitness function

The fitness of the car will be defined by the distance from the car to the parking spot. The higher the distance, the lower the fitness.

The final distance we will calculate is an average distance from 4 car wheels to the correspondent 4 corners of the parking spot. This distance we will call the loss which is inversely proportional to the fitness .

Calculating the distance between each wheel and each corner separately (instead of just calculating the distance from the car center to the parking spot center) will make the car preserve the proper orientation relative to the parking spot.

The distance between two points in space will be calculated based on the Pythagorean theorem like this:

type NumVec3 = [ number , number , number ] ; const euclideanDistance = ( from : NumVec3 , to : NumVec3 ) => { const fromX = from [ 0 ] ; const fromZ = from [ 2 ] ; const toX = to [ 0 ] ; const toZ = to [ 2 ] ; return Math . sqrt ( ( fromX - toX ) ** 2 + ( fromZ - toZ ) ** 2 ) ; } ;

The distance (the loss ) between the car and the parking spot will be calculated like this:

type RectanglePoints = { fl : NumVec3 , fr : NumVec3 , bl : NumVec3 , br : NumVec3 , } ; type GeometricParams = { wheelsPosition : RectanglePoints , parkingLotCorners : RectanglePoints , } ; const carLoss = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const { wheelsPosition , parkingLotCorners } = params ; const { fl : flWheel , fr : frWheel , br : brWheel , bl : blWheel , } = wheelsPosition ; const { fl : flCorner , fr : frCorner , br : brCorner , bl : blCorner , } = parkingLotCorners ; const flDistance = euclideanDistance ( flWheel , flCorner ) ; const frDistance = euclideanDistance ( frWheel , frCorner ) ; const brDistance = euclideanDistance ( brWheel , brCorner ) ; const blDistance = euclideanDistance ( blWheel , blCorner ) ; return ( flDistance + frDistance + brDistance + blDistance ) / 4 ; } ;

Since the fitness should be inversely proportional to the loss we'll calculate it like this:

const carFitness = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const loss = carLoss ( params ) ; return 1 / ( loss + 1 ) ; } ;

You may see the fitness and the loss values for a specific genome and for a current car position on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Launching the evolution

Let's put the evolution functions together. We're going to ""create the world"", launch the evolution loop, make the time going, the generation evolving, and the cars learning how to park.

To get the fitness values of each car we need to run a simulation of the cars behavior in a virtual 3D world. The Evolution Simulator does exactly that - it runs the code below in the simulator, which is made with Three.js:

const GENERATION_SIZE = 1000 ; const LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE = 6 ; const MUTATION_PROBABILITY = 0.04 ; const MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM = 40 ; const carFitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) : number => { const genomeKey = genome . join ( '' ) ; return fitnessValues [ genomeKey ] ; } ; let generationIndex = 0 ; let generation : Generation = createGeneration ( { generationSize : GENERATION_SIZE , genomeLength : GENOME_LENGTH , } ) ; while ( generationIndex < MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM ) { generation = select ( generation , carFitnessFunction , { mutationProbability : MUTATION_PROBABILITY , longLivingChampionsPercentage : LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE , } , ) ; generationIndex += 1 ; } const fittestCar = generation [ 0 ] ;

After running the select() function, the generation array is sorted by the fitness values in descending order. Therefore, the fittest car will always be the first car in the array.

The 1st generation of cars with random genomes will behave something like this:

On the ≈40th generation the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot:

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

The cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so you may give the cars some more time to learn.

From generation to generation we may see how the loss values are going down (which means that fitness values are going up). The P50 Avg Loss shows the average loss value (average distance from the cars to the parking spot) of the 50% of fittest cars. The Min Loss shows the loss value of the fittest car in each generation.

You may see that on average the 50% of the fittest cars of the generation are learning to get closer to the parking spot (from 5.5m away from the parking spot to 3.5m in 35 generations). The trend for the Min Loss values is less obvious (from 1m to 0.5m with some noise signals), however from the animations above you may see that cars have learned some basic parking moves.

Conclusion

In this article, we've broken down the high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level task of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeroes (finding the optimal car genome).

Then we've applied the genetic algorithm to find the optimal car genome. It allowed us to get pretty good results in several hours of simulation (instead of many years of running the naive approach).

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The full genetic source code that was shown in this article may also be found in the Evolution Simulator repository. If you are one of those folks who will actually count and check the number of lines to make sure there are less than 500 of them (excluding tests), please feel free to check the code here 🥸.

There are still some unresolved issues with the code and the simulator:

The car's brain is oversimplified and it uses linear equations instead of, let's say, neural networks. It makes the car not adaptable to the new surroundings or to the new parking lot types.

We don't decrease the car's fitness value when the car is hitting the other car. Therefore the car doesn't ""feel"" any guilt in creating the road accident.

The evolution simulator is not stable. It means that the same car genome may produce different fitness values, which makes the evolution less efficient.

The evolution simulator is also very heavy in terms of performance, which slows down the evolution progress since we can't train, let's say, 1000 cars at once.

Also the Evolution Simulator requires the browser tab to be open and active to perform the simulation.

and more...

However, the purpose of this article was to have some fun while learning how the genetic algorithm works and not to build a production-ready self-parking Teslas. So, even with the issues mentioned above, I hope you've had a good time going through the article.","['generation', 'brain', '500', 'lines', 'const', 'length', 'function', 'car', 'genome', 'code', 'cars', 'return', 'number', 'selfparking']","Self-Parking Car in 500 Lines of Code28 September, 2021 15 min to readIn this article, we'll train the car to do self-parking using a genetic algorithm.

188,Threatened Swedish artist reportedly dead in road accident,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a civilian police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were traveling, news media said.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist’s partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Muhammad drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle. He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

Vilks’ life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Al-Qaida put a bounty on Vilks’ head. In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden. Last year, a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.","['traveling', 'sculpture', 'artist', 'dogs', 'road', 'reportedly', 'sweden', 'threatened', 'vilks', 'muhammad', 'southern', 'sketch', 'dead', 'swedish', 'accident']","STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

The family of RTI activist Rai Singh Gurjar, who died in a road accident last week, has alleged foul play, claiming he was killed by people he had exposed in graft cases over the last five years.

Police have registered a case of murder against four to five people on the basis of a complaint lodged by Gurjar's family and began a probe.

However, they said it appeared to be a case of accident and the exact cause will be known after receiving the postmortem report.

The deputy sarpanch of Titarwasa gram panchayat in Jhalawar district suffered a critical head injury in a road accident late Saturday night and died during treatment.

In September 2019, the 27-year-old RTI activist had raised his voice against corruption in developmental work being carried out in Titarwasa gram panchayat, which was adopted by Vice President Venkaiah Naidu under the MP model village scheme in May 2017.

Later also, he continued to speak against corrupt practices by local officials and public representatives.

On Saturday night, Rai Gurjar suffered a critical head injury after his motorbike was hit by an auto rickshaw in Madhopura village. He was rushed to Jhalawar district hospital, where he succumbed to injuries during treatment later in the night.

""There was no mark of injury or scratch all over the body but a deep wound into his head and no mark of accident all over the place, where the accident reportedly occurred on Saturday night,"" Sujan Singh Gurjar, brother of the RTI activist said.

""The deep wound into his head apparently appeared to have been lashed with some sharp weapon,"" he said, alleging his brother was attacked with a sharp weapon and was murdered as he had been pursuing to expose corruption at various levels in different government projects being carried out in the area.

The murder was projected as a road accident, Sujan Gurjar claimed, adding that he lodged a complaint with the police on Sunday against Titarwasa gram sevak Chandra Singh, village sarpanch Kalulal Bheel, who is an accused in a graft case, Dinesh Patidar, who is involved in illegal transportation of soil, and Naipal Singh, a resident of Titarwas village.

An FIR was registered under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC against four to five persons, SHO at Jhalrapatan police station Jitendra Singh Shekhawat said.

The body was handed over to the family members after postmortem on Sunday and the exact cause of death would be clear only after receiving the postmortem report, the SHO said.

Mr Shekhawat, however, said it appeared to be a case of accident.

In its early days, the internet was described as an information superhighway. The metaphor has fallen out of use, but it captures an important truth. Highways have rules – speed limits; no drunk driving – because a free-for-all would be deadly.

The damage caused by reckless or malicious use of an information network is not as visible to passing traffic as a road accident, but there is no doubting the problem. A US Senate committee this week heard the testimony of Frances Haugen, a former employee of Facebook now turned whistleblower, on what she sees as the company’s negligent practices. Users of Facebook’s family of products number around 2.8 billion, so it matters to the whole world if they are hazardous.

Ms Haugen has leaked internal research to support her claim that the company is aware of detrimental effects caused by its services – exacerbating mental health problems in young teenagers, for example – but chooses profit over safety. She believes Facebook products “harm children, stoke division and weaken democracy”.

That effect is spread across a suite of applications. Instagram and WhatsApp are also part of the empire controlled by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive. The breadth of his realm was illustrated earlier this week when a technical fault shut down large parts of it. For most users that was a minor inconvenience, but there are places where Facebook is synonymous with the internet. Such power cannot be trusted to a negligent organisation. In Myanmar, Facebook has been a primary conduit for material inciting hatred against the Rohingya minority. The company does not dispute that it was used to instigate violence. But it focuses its moderating efforts on content in the US, since that is where it fears regulation.

The era of utopian romance around tech businesses, when it was claimed that they were connecting people for the betterment of humanity, is long past. The giants of the sector are now viewed as oligopolists, paying too little tax, hoarding personal data and neglecting the social cost of their business model.

Chemical plants are not free to discharge toxic waste into water supplies. Tobacco advertising is restricted. When, in the past, an industry’s product has been shown to cause pollution or ill health, government has stepped in. That process is catching up with Facebook. The task is much harder because the raw material it uses is information and designing regulation for that ends up in a debate over censorship. The boundary between tolerable unpleasantness and aggression against civil society is not easy to discern, as the UK government has discovered. Its online safety bill, as drafted, would hand Ofcom an awkward statutory duty to police the way digital platforms protect “democratically important” content without political bias; restricting harmful material without curtailing free expression.

But British regulation of Facebook is downstream of action taken in the US, where there is a federal move to break the company up to bolster competition. In theory, a challenger in the market could satisfy demand for a social network that takes its social responsibilities seriously. That is some way off, but Facebook’s dominance will not last forever. Its power was amassed in an era when the toxicity of its products was hidden from view. Thankfully, that era is drawing to a close.","['facebook', 'antisocial', 'products', 'information', 'haugen', 'material', 'era', 'facebooks', 'network', 'view', 'guardian', 'social', 'power']","Show caption Frances Haugen, a former employee of Facebook, testifies before a US Senate committee.

203,Mogul of Mystery,"Bride Lane Library/Popperfoto/Getty Images Robert Maxwell at a press conference announcing his acquisition of Mirror Group Newspapers, London, July 1984

Over the past two years—since the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein in July 2019 on charges of trafficking minors and then his suicide in prison; Prince Andrew’s calamitous television interview the following November, in which he tried to dissociate himself from Epstein’s crimes but instead brought his public career to an end; and the dramatic arrest in July 2020 of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s associate and former girlfriend, and her incarceration in a federal prison in Brooklyn—an image has recurred before my mind’s eye. Around ninety years ago a little boy called Jan Hoch, wearing a yarmulke and curled sidelocks, belonged to an Orthodox Jewish community—impoverished, Yiddish-speaking, devout—in the small town of Solotvino in Subcarpathian Ruthenia. His mother wanted him to be a rabbi, and he was destined for the yeshiva in Pressburg (now Bratislava) until war engulfed Europe. Although he escaped, and after many adventures entirely reinvented himself, a horrible fate awaited his family.

That little boy was Ghislaine Maxwell’s father. The story of Robert Maxwell—as Jan Hoch of Solotvino became after he had been variously “Private Leslie Jones,” “Lance-Corporal Leslie Smith,” “Sergeant Ivan du Maurier,” and “Captain Stone”—is so ghastly and so ludicrous and altogether so improbable that it might seem stranger than fiction. There might be echoes from Victorian novels—Mr. Merdle, the “man of the age” before he goes bust in Little Dorrit, or the still more mysterious financier Melmotte in The Way We Live Now—but neither Dickens nor Trollope could quite have invented Maxwell. He was by turns a desperate refugee, a brave soldier, a seemingly successful entrepreneur, a member of Parliament, a newspaper owner, and, as it transpired after his death, an outrageous swindler.

John Preston opens his entertaining and gruesome Fall with a scene earlier in the year of Maxwell’s death. In March 1991 he arrived in New York aboard his yacht, Lady Ghislaine, named after the daughter he had once neglected and bullied but who had become his loyal helpmate and accompanied him on this trip. He was there to pull off what he presented as his greatest coup yet by buying the New York Daily News. Eight months later the yacht was cruising off the Canary Islands with Maxwell aboard until November 5, when he disappeared. Soon afterward, his floating body was found, leaving a final riddle: Accident, suicide, or murder?

This man of mystery was formed by a bleak early life. He was born in 1923, one of the nine children of Mehel and Chanca Hoch, who lived in a two-room shack with a dirt floor. He loved, and was loved by, his mother, but was often beaten by his cruel father, the six-foot-five “Mehel the Tall,” who scratched such living as he could by buying animal skins from butchers and selling them to leather dealers; from him the son inherited his size and maybe his temperament. Much about Maxwell could be understood as a reaction to his childhood, his gluttony and love of luxury set against the poverty and hunger he had once known, his longing for power against powerlessness, maybe even his cruelty to others against the cruelty he had suffered.

Another heritage was his polyglotism. Solotvino lies in a region that during the past hundred and more years has changed hands repeatedly. Between the wars it was at the eastern extremity of Czechoslovakia, having previously been part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; it then belonged briefly to Hungary, then the Soviet Union, and now is in Ukraine. Its Jews often acquired perforce several languages, and as an adult Maxwell could speak English (very distinctively), French, German, Russian, and Czech. Any religious heritage, on the other hand, he soon shed. Maxwell might be thought almost what the Irish call a spoiled priest, dropping out of the yeshiva and never again entering a synagogue for most of his life.

In March 1939 Czechoslovakia fell apart. Hitler arrived in Prague to declare the Czech rump a Reich dependency, while Slovakia became a puppet state under Monsignor Jozef Tiso, one of the more repellent prelates of that dark age for the Roman Catholic Church, who was later executed as a war criminal. Then in September Germany invaded Poland. Barely sixteen, Hoch managed to flee Solotvino. Many years later he gave one version of his adventures to a hagiographer, claiming that he had walked to Budapest, been imprisoned, and then fought off his warder and escaped, but he was such a fabulist that nothing he said can be accepted with any certainty. At any rate, he seems to have made his roundabout way to France and the exiled Czech army.

There’s no ambiguity about what happened to his family. Before the war had ended, Maxwell’s mother and father, grandfather, and three of his younger siblings were transported to Auschwitz and murdered. For many years Maxwell tried to obliterate this horror, never mentioning his childhood, origins, religion, parents, or their horrible deaths.

In late July 1940, Preston writes, “in French army uniform, carrying a rifle in his hand and unable to speak a word of English, the yet-to-be Robert Maxwell” disembarked in Liverpool. He had just turned seventeen and still wasn’t of military age, but he contrived to join the menial Pioneer Corps, digging ditches alongside more eminent refugees, German-Jewish doctors and musicians. A brief encounter with a woman shopkeeper helped him learn English, although he said that he had already learned it by listening to broadcasts of Winston Churchill’s speeches before he could understand them and absorbing their distinctive tones, which he fondly believed he could emulate.

By 1944 he had joined the British infantry, after changing his name regularly. The Normandy campaign found him as Sergeant du Maurier, from a popular brand of cigarette, leading a sniper section of the North Staffordshire Regiment with enough distinction to win a commission, and by March 1945 Captain Robert Maxwell, as he had finally become, won the Military Cross ( MC ), pinned on his chest by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery himself. He went beyond the call of duty in his own way. Maxwell much later described one incident when he shouted in German to enemy soldiers in a farmhouse, “Come out with your hands up. You are completely surrounded.” When they did, “I shot them all with my sub-machine-gun. I thought my boys would be pleased, but all they said was, ‘That’s not fair, sir, those lads had surrendered.’”

In Paris a few months after its liberation Maxwell met Elisabeth Meynard, known as Betty, at a servicemen’s club, swept her off her feet, and married her despite the apprehensions of her prosperous French Protestant family. “Long-suffering” is wholly inadequate to describe a woman who stuck with her monstrous husband until the end despite endless infidelities and scandals. They had four sons and five daughters. Ghislaine, the youngest, was born in 1961, three days before the eldest boy was so gravely injured in a road accident that he spent the remaining six years of his life in a coma. The children were treated horribly by their father, who belittled and humiliated them at every turn. At first Ghislaine was the worst victim, to the point that she was anorexic as a child, but Maxwell relented and she became his favorite, expensively educated at boarding school and Oxford, until Betty could call Ghislaine “spoiled, the only one of my children I can truly say that about.”

If the story of young Hoch’s escape from Solotvino was obscure, Captain Maxwell’s career after the war was also murky. He ended up in Berlin serving in British intelligence, which he may have done for some time after he left the army, while possibly working for other countries’ intelligence services as well. “Later on in life, he could never pass a spotlight without stepping into it,” Preston writes, but at this time, “like Harry Lime in…The Third Man, Maxwell seemed to belong in the shadows, slipping quietly from occupied zone to occupied zone.”

In Berlin he also found the basis of his fortune. He helped run a newspaper owned by Springer-Verlag, which before the war had been the world’s largest publisher of scientific books and journals, and struck a deal with Ferdinand Springer, the head of the firm. By then Maxwell had learned of his parents’ death, but as part of his willful erasure of the past he was quite ready to do business with a man who had prospered under the Third Reich. Springer needed someone who could sell his products internationally, and Maxwell was that someone. By 1948 he had secured world distribution rights to all of Springer-Verlag’s publications. Preston writes that “150 tons of books and another 150 tons of journals were loaded on to a goods train and taken to Bielefeld in western Germany. From there, a convoy of trucks brought them to London,” although the figures seem astonishing.

Soon afterward Maxwell bought into a small trading company, but he required the marketing weight of a larger established publisher, and acquired Butterworth, which specialized in medical and legal textbooks. After he created Butterworth–Springer as a subsidiary, he also needed capital, and Major John Whitlock, the head of Butterworth, introduced him to Sir Charles Hambro, scion of a banking dynasty, who “took an immediate shine to Maxwell.” His links to British intelligence may have helped, since Whitlock and Hambro had both served in that twilight world.

In later years not only was Maxwell’s reputation terrible but his personality was repulsive, the embodiment of what his native Yiddish calls grobkeit, boorish and vulgar. But before the passage of time coarsened him he must have been more personable, and for many years a remarkable number of people in the English commercial and financial establishment were taken in by him. With Hambro’s help Maxwell created a British distributor, whose turnover more than doubled between 1950 and 1951, when he changed the name of Butterworth–Springer to Pergamon. Scientific books and journals were a real money-spinner, since universities and libraries needed them, and learned authors didn’t expect to be paid.

Some of the refugees who enlivened London publishing after the war—André Deutsch, Paul Hamlyn, George Weidenfeld—might have been colorful and not always popular with their long-established rivals, but Maxwell was something else again. As he ensconced himself at Headington Hill Hall outside Oxford, Preston says, “darkness—and the whiff of chicanery—was never far away.” Nigel Lawson would one day be chancellor of the exchequer in Margaret Thatcher’s government, but in the early 1950s he was an Oxford undergraduate and found a lowly vacation job working at Maxwell’s warehouse, where he was startled to find that school textbooks rejected as defective in England were being sold in Africa.

For his next move Maxwell went into politics, capriciously choosing Labour, and in 1964 Captain Maxwell added “ MP ” to the “ MC ” after his name when he was elected to Parliament as member for Buckingham. The Labour Party didn’t know quite what to make of this “very strange fellow,” as the diarist, former Oxford don, and future cabinet minister Richard Crossman described him: “a Czech Jew with a perfect knowledge of Russian, who has an infamous reputation in the publishing world.” The House of Commons didn’t know what to make of him either, as he became a byword for bombastic garrulity. Completely ignoring parliamentary convention about the length and frequency of speeches, he held forth more than two hundred times in ten months. He was made chairman of the Commons catering committee partly to shut him up, and he soon wrote off the debts of loss-making bars and dining rooms through what was effectively a fire sale, disposing of the cellar of fine wines for far beneath their value, plenty of them ending up at Headington Hill Hall.

Few at Westminster were sorry to see Maxwell lose his seat in 1970, when he returned to his lurid business career. Before floating Pergamon on the stock exchange in 1964 he had created tax-free trusts in Liechtenstein to make his dealings as opaque as possible, but when in 1969 an American firm bid to take over the company, it withdrew its offer after discovering that Maxwell had inflated sales and profit figures. By 1971 inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry had scrutinized Maxwell’s affairs and published a report describing him as “not…a person who can be relied on to exercise proper stewardship of a publicly quoted company.”

It might seem extraordinary that he could have continued in business at all after that. But Maxwell wasn’t called “the bouncing Czech” for nothing, and soon he bounced back, with his new ambition to become a press magnate. He had already tried and failed to buy the Sun (formerly the Daily Herald, and the voice of the Labour Party) before attempting to buy News of the World, that monument to English salacious prurience. “It would not be a good thing for Mr. Maxwell,” said the editor, Stafford Somerfield, “formerly Jan Ludwig Hoch, to gain control of…a newspaper which I know is as British as roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.” Those distasteful words had an unintended effect, quickening the interest of a young entrepreneur who was as British as roast wallaby. Rupert Murdoch pounced, and his acquisition of News of the World in 1968 began his adventure as a London media mogul. It also began a comical rivalry that lasted more than two decades, in which Maxwell was always outplayed by Murdoch. He thought he was fighting another boxer, the late Harold Evans observed, when “in fact, he’d entered the ring with a ju-jitsu artist who also happened to be carrying a stiletto.” Whatever else one thinks of him, Murdoch was a formidable operator, whereas Maxwell was always a sham.

And yet bouncing on he went, fending off criminal charges all the while, and by 1981 he had acquired control of the British Printing Corporation, until recently the largest printing group in the country, which he renamed the Maxwell Communications Corporation ( MCC ). In 1984 he achieved what seemed a real triumph by buying the Daily Mirror. In its midcentury heyday it had been a great popular newspaper that had won the circulation war as the first true voice of the English working class, and it was still the second-best-selling paper in the country after Murdoch’s Sun. I was in San Francisco for the Democratic Convention when news of the sale reached us, and a group of English scribblers repaired to a bar near Union Square, where Keith Waterhouse, a veteran Mirror columnist, danced a little jig mocking “Cap’n Bob,” before he escaped to the Daily Mail.

What happened next was no laughing matter. Or rather, Maxwell became a bad joke, as he turned the paper into a vehicle for his own glorification, with his face continually appearing in its pages and his fatuous opinions trumpeted. The staff shuddered at his profane and abusive tirades, shouted over the vast coffee cup on his desk that bore the motto “ VERY IMPORTANT PERSON .” He nevertheless found people ready to do his bidding. Roy Greenslade would later write in haughty tones about media matters for The Guardian while clandestinely helping the terrorist Irish Republican Army, as he has recently admitted, but he had earlier served as Maxwell’s editor of the Mirror, and at his behest rigged the competitions in the paper so that the prizes offered would never be won. Before Alastair Campbell became Tony Blair’s spin doctor and helped orchestrate the war of lies that preceded the invasion of Iraq, he also worked for Maxwell. Joe Haines, formerly press officer to Harold Wilson at Downing Street, wrote a ludicrously heroic “official biography” of Maxwell, and Peter Jay, who had been the British ambassador in Washington, became his “chief of staff.”

In 1986 the Thatcher government drastically deregulated the financial markets of the City of London, which was meant to lead to a new golden age of vigorous competition, as was similar deregulation of Wall Street. What ensued was a weird era of reckless casino capitalism, with dazzling innovations like credit default swaps and subprime mortgages, all leading to the crash of 2008. But there was a foretaste of that by way of Maxwell. By the late 1980s his vaunted business empire was in deep trouble, requiring one surreptitious expedient after another to disguise its grave condition. In the hope of cleansing his name Maxwell offered numerous charitable donations—for AIDS research, for starving Ethiopians—but somehow the promised funds rarely arrived.

And yet still the banks—forty-four of them at one point!—lined up to lend him money. They accepted MCC stock as collateral, requiring more stock to be transferred if the share price fell below a certain point, not bothering to wonder whether the price had any real meaning. In fact, while Maxwell was servicing his debts by mortgaging stock (“pig on pork,” as the term of art has it), he was inflating that price by buying MCC stock with money he first borrowed, then stole. As he edged ever closer to the brink he used the oppressive English libel laws to silence critics, notably Private Eye, but when in July 1990 the Financial Times took a hard look and said that shares in his company were essentially worthless, he didn’t dare sue.

Nor was his next (and last) victory all he claimed. By the time Maxwell proudly bought it, the Daily News was near collapse, with circulation plummeting, production controlled by the unions, and distribution controlled by the mob. There was one moment of comic relief when a print union negotiator said that Maxwell seemed “like an English nobleman,” a unique estimation. An even better one came when he insinuated himself into a Washington lunch party where he sat next to President George H.W. Bush and loudly held forth on world affairs. As the bemused Bush left he could be seen mouthing, “Who was that guy?” Funniest of all was when Maxwell ordered Jim Hoge, the publisher of the Daily News, to ring Murdoch in the middle of the Australian night and say that he had bought the paper, at which Murdoch burst into laughter and thanked Maxwell for being so helpful.

Shortly thereafter came his mysterious death. An autopsy showed that he had been alive for hours in the water and may have desperately clung to the boat before his heart gave out, which could suggest an accident, but he had good reason to end it all. And enough was already known about him to make the tributes he received quite grotesque. The recently deposed Thatcher said that Maxwell had shown the world “that one person can move and influence events by using his own God-given talents and abilities,” the Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock called him “one of the few people I have known who deserved to be called irreplaceable,” while Mikhail Gorbachev was “deeply grieved.”

And then the shattering truth emerged. Maxwell’s whole operation was fraudulent: it collapsed with debts of several billion pounds, with the banks that had accepted stock as collateral losing £655 million. Worst of all, the desperate Maxwell had looted £429 million from his companies’ pension funds, including the Mirror’s.

Nothing in this story is so strange as Maxwell’s identity, or what he made of it. He transformed himself into his version of an English—or Scottish—officer and gentleman. About five years before his death, he was dining in Edinburgh with Ian Watson, one of his editors, when the floodlights silhouetting Edinburgh Castle against the night sky came on. “Look, Watty,” Maxwell said, “there’s a sight to warm the hearts of true Scotsmen like you and me!” Watson thought he was joking: “It took a few moments for me to realize Maxwell was being completely serious.”

When he was elected to Parliament in 1964 Maxwell was called by the Jewish Chronicle, which likes to take note of Jewish achievements, including the number of MP s. “I’m not Jewish,” said the sometime yeshiva boy, and put down the telephone. Twenty years later, in the witness box at one of his court cases, he tearfully recalled his mother’s death in Auschwitz, which cynics thought a convenient turn at a time when he wanted sympathy. But his belated acceptance might have been prompted by his personal disintegration, or maybe intimations of mortality.

Did he try to come to terms with the past he had so long concealed? He had begun giving—or at least promising—money to Israeli charities, and when he died no one was more fulsome than Shimon Peres, the former prime minister and future president of Israel, who called Maxwell “not a man but an empire in his power, thought and deeds.” Before the awful truth became known, his body was taken to Jerusalem and given something like a state funeral on the Mount of Olives.

The victim, 39-year-old Sanjeev M Patil, was knocked down by a state transport bus while he was crossing the road at Jall tollgate in Bengaluru-Pune Highway around 6 am.

The family went to the court to seek compensation on the grounds that Sanjeev was just 39 years at the time of the accident and was earning Rs 2.10 lakh per month at IBM. The family claimed compensation to the tune of Rs 3.55 crore along with interest.

NWKRTC claimed that the accident occurred on account of Sanjeev’s negligence. However, the court held that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving by the bus driver. The court also observed that an independent witness blamed the driver and the NWKSRTC did not have any evidence to prove that Patil’s negligence led to his death.

The court held that the claimants were entitled to a compensation of Rs 2.15 crore along with an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum to be paid by the NWKSRTC.

The second additional senior civil judge at Davanagere said, “court which went through the documents and salary slips came to a conclusion that Sanjeev Patil monthly income was Rs 1,57,178 and deducting the personal expenses of Sanjeev Patil, it comes around Rs 1,17,884. Taking account of the age, 15 multiplier was adopted and Rs 2,12,19,120 on account loss of dependency and with 8 per cent annual interest from the date of the accident.”

Speaking to indianexpress.com, Jagadeesh VS, divisional controller of NWKRTC’s Haveri division, who is the first respondent in the case, said: ”We have paid Rs 1.52 crore compensation and had taken the case to the high court. However, there was no stay order which made the court officials seize the bus. We are asking the court to give us more time to pay the money as the corporation has also run into huge losses due to Covid-19 situation.

He said that a bus costs about Rs 29 lakh and the bus that was seized is two years old and did not operate much due to the pandemic situation.","['bus', 'paying', 'court', 'compensation', 'rs', 'account', 'road', 'seizes', 'crore', 'karnataka', 'victim', 'governments', 'pay', 'family', 'sanjeev', 'accident']","In a first, a lower court in Karnataka has seized a bus belonging to the state-run corporation after it failed to pay Rs 2.82 crore compensation to a road accident victim’s family.

211,Bengaluru: Web-based GIS system to make commute safer for school-goers,"In a bid to ensure safe commute to school-goers in Bengaluru, a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) tool named Safer Access to Schools (SATS) has been launched in the city.

According to its inventors World Resources Institute (WRI) India, an organisation dealing with environmental and sustainability research, and Underwriters Laboratories, the tool is expected to help policymakers make informed decisions.

According to a recent study, 86 per cent of school children travel less than five kilometres to reach their schools in the city while 58 per cent of them walk to schools.

Sree Kumar Kumaraswamy, head of integrated transport, WRI India, noted that there is a crucial gap in data-based understanding and interventions linked to safety around schools.

“Data is crucial to develop an evidence-based understanding of road safety concerns along each of the schools and can bring together various government stakeholders, NGOs, researchers, and private individuals towards a collaborative action,” he said.

Further, WRI shared insights into road accident fatalities in the city noting that nearly 31 per cent of pedestrian crash fatalities and six per cent of children’s fatalities occurred within 250 metres of the school zone, citing National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data from 2019.

Meanwhile, participating in a discussion titled ‘Enabling Safer Streets for Bengaluru’ at WRI India’s ‘Connect Karo 2021’ event, joint commissioner (traffic) B R Ravikanthe Gowda conceded that space constraints for pedestrians to walk on the road is observed in many areas of the city.

“Some schools in Bengaluru have gates opening directly to the roads. With no specific parking areas available, students get on and off vehicles on the roads, and school managements choose not to bother about them once they are left outside the premises,” Gowda noted.

The top traffic cop stressed the need to prioritise pedestrian safety while designing roads, adding that the Bengaluru traffic police force was also taking measures to impart traffic education to students in schools.

“More pedestrian fatalities in road accidents are getting reported in outer parts of the city than those in CBD (central business district) areas. We need to prioritise the safety of pedestrians while designing roads,” he said.

Meanwhile, Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) commissioner V Manjula said that work is progressing on an ‘Active Mobility Act’, expected to give pedestrians and cyclists the right to complete and connected networks.

“It puts the onus on local bodies to provide good infrastructure and has provisions for ‘mobility wardens’ from the public, who can give suggestions for infrastructural improvements. We need coordination and design policies in place, which will be followed by all stakeholders,” she explained.","['wri', 'roads', 'webbased', 'school', 'schools', 'commute', 'road', 'fatalities', 'gis', 'cent', 'bengaluru', 'schoolgoers', 'system', 'traffic', 'safer', 'safety']","In a bid to ensure safe commute to school-goers in Bengaluru, a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) tool named Safer Access to Schools (SATS) has been launched in the city.

212,"Karnataka: Mother kills adult daughter to hide affair, father helps in dumping body","Karnataka police have arrested three persons for the murder of a 28-year-old woman in Chikkaballapura district. Among those arrested were the murder victim’s parents and uncle. While the mother and the uncle allegedly killed the woman, the victim’s father conspired to pass off the murder as suicide, thinking it to be a case of honour killing.

Chikkaballapura district superintendent of police Mithun Kumar GK said, “Parveena Banu alias Shilpa, a resident of Musalmanarahalli, was murdered earlier this month. Her parents, Gulzar Banu (45) and Fayaz (50), and uncle, Pyaarejan (60), have been arrested in connection to her death. Fayaz is speech impaired and Parveena was his eldest daughter.”

Chikkaballapura district police said the incident took place on September 4.

Cops said that Parveena Banu was murdered after she came to know about her mother’s extra-marital relationship with her uncle. Cops said that Parveena Banu was murdered after she came to know about her mother’s extra-marital relationship with her uncle.

Police sources said Parveena was married to a man from the same community around 10 years ago, but she separated from him a day after their marriage. She then married her boyfriend, Shivappa, who was a resident of Manivala village, and changed her name to Shilpa. But Shivappa was an alcoholic and died owing to poor health. Parveena later started living with another man but he, too, died in a road accident.

Cops said that Parveena was murdered after she came to know about her mother’s extra-marital relationship with her uncle. To hide their affair, Pyaarejan strangled her with a jacket.

After committing the murder, Pyaarejan told Fayaz that they killed Parveena for she had married a man from another religion. Parveena’s father, Fayaz, who was not aware of his wife’s affair with Pyaarejan, helped in transporting the body and dumping it in a dry well in Vatadahosahalli.

On September 5, Gauribidanur rural police retrieved Parveena’s body from the well and an autopsy was conducted on it. Police initially assumed that Parveena might have died by suicide but the post-mortem report suggested that she was strangled to death.

Police, finally, cracked the case after checking the call detail record of Parveena’s mobile phone. Cops found that Parveena had last spoken to her mother and uncle. Upon questioning, both the culprits confessed to their crime. Parveena’s father was arrested for his role in hiding the murder.

Sources said that Fayaz did not know that Parveena was killed to hide the truth of his wife’s affair and now regrets to have helped in covering up the murder.","['helps', 'kills', 'mother', 'uncle', 'murdered', 'affair', 'dumping', 'murder', 'parveenas', 'fayaz', 'parveena', 'hide', 'father', 'daughter', 'arrested', 'banu', 'body', 'karnataka', 'know', 'pyaarejan']","Chikkaballapura district superintendent of police Mithun Kumar GK said, “Parveena Banu alias Shilpa, a resident of Musalmanarahalli, was murdered earlier this month.

213,"In 20 days, three cops severely injured in road accidents while on duty","THREE UT police personnel, who were critically wounded while performing their duties, have been admitted to the PGIMER and undergoing multiple surgeries. While two of them, Deepak and Harsh Kumar, were knocked down by speedy vehicles while performing traffic duties, a woman constable, Papita, on cash protection duty, was almost crushed between two vehicles carrying cash that belonged to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Both her legs were severely injured. While Papita with met the tragic road accident on September 6, constable Deepak was injured near the Police Beat Box in Sector 36 on September 23. Head Constable Harsh Kumar, a member of the UT Police Cycle Squad, was injured on the cycle track near Sector 45 on September 24.

Constable Papita has undergone at least seven surgeries, since, and more are underway. She says, “My left leg was completely motionless. But now there is sensation in my left leg. Though both my legs were severely wounded, the left leg received maximum injuries. I am grateful to my senior officers and the police department, for bearing the expenses of my treatment.” After an hour long rescue operation, uncertainty still loomed over her fate, as she was pulled out from the remains of the front body of the truck. She continues to be admitted at PGI.

Constable Deepak, who was posted near Sector 36 Beat Box was knocked down by a speedy car. He received critical head injuries. He, too, was rushed to PGI and underwent a head surgery. “Doctors have successfully removed a big blood clot from the head but Deepak is still under observation. His behavior is unusual. Sometimes he starts shouting about his naka duties. Doctors told us that he will be absolutely fine within a couple of days,” said a close relative of Deepak. He has been admitted in the Neuro-surgical ward.

“Harsh is said to be stable but doctors told us that it will at least take a year for Harsh to fully recover from his jaw and bone injuries. Immediately after the incident, Harsh was rushed to GMCH-32. Today, we took him to PGI for his jaw surgery. Harsh’s treatment has cost around Rs 50,000 so far. The police department is cooperating with us. They have given around Rs 15,000 for the treatment. The senior officers are cooperating”, said Deepak Kumar, Harsh’s elder brother.

214,Madras HC quashes order increasing speed limit to 120 kmph on highways,"The Madras High Court has set aside a notification of the central government, fixing 120 kmph as the speed limit for vehicles plying on highways.

A division bench of Justices N Kirubakaran (since retired) and Justice T V Thamilselvi, which quashed the notification dated April 6, 2018, recently, also directed the Centre and the State to issue fresh notifications with decreased speed limit.

Originally, while passing interim orders on an appeal on March 3 this year, the bench, the other member being Justice Abdul Quddhose, increased the compensation amount from Rs 18.43 lakh to Rs 1.50 crore to the appellant — a dentist, who had suffered 90 per cent disability due to a road accident occurred in April 2013 in Kancheepuram in Tamil Nadu.

The bench had also raised a set of 12 queries, the first of which was for a direction to the central government to reconsider its 2018 notification, increasing the speed limit to 120 kmph. The matter was posted in August for filing compliance report.

In its report, the Centre justified its action in increasing the speed limit. It said that keeping in view the better engine technology and improved road infrastructure, an expert committee was constituted to review the speed limits of motor vehicles and as per its recommendations, the maximum speeds for vehicles on different roads had been revised by the Ministry in the April 6 2018 notification.

However, the present bench observed that though there was a better engine technology and improved road infrastructure, there was no improvement in compliance of the road safety rules by the motorists.

From the report released by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, the number of deaths taking place on roads would prove that more accidents were occurring due to over speeding.

Also Read | Tamil is the Language of Gods, says Madras High Court

When over speeding was a major cause for road accidents, it is not known as to how the improvement in road infrastructure and engine technology would reduce accidents. In fact, better engine technology would always be a reason for uncontrolled speed and thereby, cause more accidents, the bench said.

“Having known that over speeding is the main cause for road accidents, taking away the precious lives of people and causing damage to properties, the decision taken by the central government, as reflected in the notification dated April 6, 2018 is liable to be quashed.” the bench said and accordingly quashed it.

It also said that the State and the central governments should reduce the speed limit as per August 5, 2014 notification and prescribed a set of speed limits for different types of vehicles.

“Though the matter arises under the Motor Vehicles Act, taking note of a dentist sustaining spinal cord injury and that she is unable to do any work on her own and that she has to depend on others throughout her life, this court invoking Article 226 of the Constitution, suo motu, in public interest, passed this judgment,” the bench added.","['order', '120', 'madras', 'kmph', 'speed', 'technology', 'road', 'accidents', 'increasing', 'quashes', 'hc', 'engine', 'limit', 'notification', 'vehicles', 'central', 'bench', 'highways']","The Madras High Court has set aside a notification of the central government, fixing 120 kmph as the speed limit for vehicles plying on highways.

215,Making streets safe for all: Delhi govt launches six-month online campaign on road safety,"In an attempt to reduce the number of deaths on the streets, the Transport Department has launched a social media campaign, #SadakSurakshitDilliSurakshit. It is aimed at generating online conversations and awareness on four risk factors – speeding, drunk driving, wearing helmets and seatbelts.

A collaboration between the Delhi government and the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, the campaign was launched by Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot at the Road Safety Summit on Friday morning. Over the next six months, @delhiroadsafety will raise awareness on Facebook and Twitter.

“The roads belong to pedestrians as much as they belong to people in vehicles. Through our campaign, we hope to increase awareness about evidence-based best practices in road safety and ensure Delhi roads are safer for all road users. Through the Delhi government’s partnership with the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, we aim to reduce these deaths on the streets of Delhi and hope to build an ecosystem where we do not tolerate any loss of life on our streets,” said Gahlot.

A number of important conversations revolving around road safety were taken up at the summit, with officials and experts sharing the stage.

They said that last year, 1,196 persons were killed while 3,662 persons were left injured in road crashes in the city. They spoke about how deaths and injuries are preventable by means of safer street designs, changes in behaviour supported by strategic communication and enforcement of traffic laws and use of high-quality data for strengthening road safety policies.

A Road Safety Action Plan was presented by Deepak Kumar IAS, Special Commissioner, Road Safety, Transport Department. In his presentation, he spoke about how there has been a 42 per cent decline in accidents over the last decade. Their vision for 2030 is to prevent 50 per cent road traffic deaths and injuries. This can be done by structural intervention, engaging stakeholders, technological intervention, road safety partnerships and regulatory approach.

Structural intervention would include identifying blackspots, creating safe school zones, pedestrian-friendly streetscaping and lane disciplining. At present, 20 blackspots have been identified in the city. He elaborated that implementing an Integrated Road Accident Database (an application to record and manage crash data) would help. Further, he said that Delhi has been treating driving as a life skill and as a first of its kind in the world, automated driving tracks are being set up in educational institutes.

A panel discussion on how Delhi can prevent 50 per cent fatal crashes was held. Experts also discussed the need to create more safe school zones as a number of government school students in the city walk to school and they perceive speeding as a threat. A pilot project has been taken up around a government school in Vasant Kunj and more such projects will be taken up soon.

Another panel discussion regarding the role of citizen groups in supporting the government’s efforts to prevent crashes was discussed. Officials also stressed on the redevelopment of 540 km stretch of roads, which will make a huge part of the city more pedestrian-friendly.","['city', 'roads', 'launches', 'school', 'streets', 'govt', 'transport', 'road', 'taken', 'safe', 'sixmonth', 'online', 'making', 'deaths', 'delhi', 'safety']","A collaboration between the Delhi government and the Bloomberg Philanthropies Initiative for Global Road Safety, the campaign was launched by Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot at the Road Safety Summit on Friday morning.

216,Maximum road deaths in Bengaluru are reported on Sundays,"Despite weekend lockdowns owing to the Covid-19 pandemic being in force for the greater part of last year, Bengaluru city reported a higher number of deaths and accidents on Sundays.

Like the rest of the country, the city was under lockdown from the last week of March to the first week of June in 2020. Thereafter, the state government enforced weekend lockdowns for a few more months.

In 2020, Bengaluru city reported 657 deaths due to road accidents, of which 109 fatal accidents were reported on Sundays alone. While the number of deaths due to road accidents has come down compared to 2019 (832 deaths) and 2018 (870 deaths), officials attribute the development to the Covid-19 lockdown and associated curbs. Even in previous years, Sundays reported more road accidents compared to other days of the week. While Saturdays recorded fewer fatalities.

Speaking to the IndianExpress.com, joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda said, “Many people who come to Bengaluru during weekends are in a hurry to return to their places on Sundays, leading to a higher number of road accidents. Notably, most mishaps reported on Sundays result from speeding.”

Asked whether lockdown reduced the number of road accidents, Gowda said: “It might have been a factor but the enforcement of laws has played a vital role in reducing the numbers.”

Nightmare for pedestrians

In 2020, 164 pedestrians died in the city due to road accidents, but what continues to be a major concern is that many of the victims lost their lives despite adhering to traffic rules. At least 82 persons died even when they were standing in areas designated for pedestrians. Nearly 332 two-wheeler riders also died in road mishaps.

The data revealed that 189 persons in the 21-30 age group died in road accidents in 2020. Whereas 101 persons aged between 41-50 and 73 persons between 51-60 years lost their lives. Fifty-five persons in the age group of 11-20 also perished in road accidents.

Of the 655 persons accused in road accidents, 438 were in the 21-40 age group. These included 273 self-accidents. Only 17 persons above 61 years were accused of road accidents.

The data also revealed that 51 per cent of accident victims in 2020 died even before they could be taken to a hospital. While 162 persons died on the spot, another 177 persons died on their way to a hospital. Sadly, 308 persons succumbed to their injuries in hospital. The traffic police in its report said that passers-by often failed to respond adequately during the golden hour (the first hour after the accident) and in several instances were seen taking videos and photos of the accident sites and the victims.

217,"Teenager run over in Alwar, family alleges involvement of cow vigilantes","A 16-year-old boy in Rajasthan’s Alwar district was allegedly run over by self-styled cow vigilantes on Sunday morning, his family members have alleged.

The police have said that the boy, identified as Sabir Khan, a resident of Sare Kalan village in Tijara tehsil of Alwar district, died in a vehicle collision after being caught in the middle of a chase between alleged cow smugglers and people chasing them. The teenager’s family members, however, accused the police of trying to suppress the matter.

According to the FIR registered in the matter, the incident took place at around 5:45 am on Sunday morning near Nehar Khedi Road in Alwar district.

Sabir’s family members have stated in the FIR that the teen, along with his friends, would go running every morning and around 4-5 days ago, they had an argument with one Anil over the latter’s reckless driving.

“On that day, Anil had threatened my nephew and his companions that ‘after today if I see you running on this road, then I will run you down with this car and you won’t be do anything to me because I have relationships with Gauraksha Dal and Bajrangbal (sic)’,” says the FIR lodged by Sabir’s uncle after the incident.

The FIR says that after running over Sabir with their car on Sunday morning, the accused also reminded his friends of his prior threat.

Sabir’s friend Mohammed Alim, 20, who was present at the time of the incident, said: “Each day, several of our friends would go for running on that road. Some time back, we had an argument with Anil, a resident of a nearby village, when we asked him not to overspeed since we run on that road. Anil had threatened us at that time. He works with the Bajrang Dal. On Sunday morning, after running over Sabir, he slowed down the car and told me, I have run over your brother, now you know me,” said 20-year-old Mohammed Alim, who was present at the time of the incident.

He claimed that after Anil hit Sabir with his car, another car which was also being driven by his associates drove over the boy.

Imran Khan, a cousin brother of Sabir, said: “Sabir was studying in class 11 and wanted to join the Army. Each day, along with his friends he would go on a run and exercise early in the morning. Earlier as well, people from nearby village Bhogipur who are associated with the gau raksha dal and Bajrang Dal had threatened the kids. On Sunday, they deliberately ran Sabir over with their vehicles despite the fact that he was standing at the side of the road. These people have created a terror here in the name of cow protection.”

On the basis of the complaint submitted by the family of Sabir, the police have registered an FIR at the Chupanki police station under sections 302 (murder), 143 (unlawful assembly) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), naming seven accused — Anil, Mintu, Himansu, Pushkar, Soun, Rahul and Abu, all residents of Haryana.

“Preliminary investigation suggests that a vehicle in which cows were being transported was passing the area and it hit Sabir. The people in that vehicle were cow smugglers. There was another vehicle driven by locals which was following the cow smugglers to catch them. This vehicle too hit Sabir. An FIR has also been registered at the Tauru Sadar police station in Nuh district of Haryana against the cow smugglers and 15 cows were found in their vehicle. Sabir was hit by two vehicles — one being driven by the cow smugglers, other belonging to those chasing the smugglers,” said Hari Ram Kumawat, deputy superintendent of police, Bhiwadi police circle.

He added that so far the police have arrested three people Sonu, Narendra and Harkesh in the matter on the basis of police investigation.

Family members of Sabir, including his cousin Imran and brother-in-law Shahrukh, accused the police of trying to suppress the matter.

“The police want to completely change the direction of the case and suppress the issue. There is no role of any vehicle transporting cows. The accused threatened the kids before and then killed Sabir,” said Imran.

Alim, who was on the spot at the time of the incident, said that Sabir was hit by cars being driven by the accused and denied that he was hit by a vehicle transporting cows.

The police denied the allegations of police inaction.

“The family members have said in the FIR that the accused had threatened them before. But in preliminary investigation we haven’t found anything to corroborate this. It appears to be a case of road accident but still, we are carrying out the investigation and more will be clear after the probe. An FIR has been registered in Haryana related to cow smuggling and we have registered an FIR regarding the death of the kid. It is wrong to say that police are trying to suppress the matter,” said Bhiwadi SP Ram Moorty Joshi.

He added that in preliminary investigation association of the accused with any organization hasn’t been found and further probe is being conducted.","['smugglers', 'anil', 'vigilantes', 'accused', 'sabir', 'vehicle', 'road', 'morning', 'teenager', 'alwar', 'fir', 'cow', 'involvement', 'alleges', 'run', 'hit', 'family']","A 16-year-old boy in Rajasthan’s Alwar district was allegedly run over by self-styled cow vigilantes on Sunday morning, his family members have alleged.

218,Bewilderment by Richard Powers review – stars in their eyes,"We might think of Richard Powers as one of contemporary fiction’s big-game hunters, were that not a woefully inappropriate tag for a novelist whose recent work is animated by a truly non-Hemingwayan philosophical orientation: deep ecology. The Overstory, a novel of the highest ambition and ideational scope for which Powers was awarded a Pulitzer prize, explored territory usually ceded to writers of science fiction: the frontier relationship between the human and the nonhuman (specifically, our planet’s trees, given dramatic life as intelligent and interconnected species).

Bewilderment, Powers’s more immediate new novel, is narrated in the first-person and is half the length of The Overstory’s wilderness stretch. Theo Byrne is a grieving widower and astrobiologist whose work involves building simulated worlds to help determine whether exoplanets beyond our solar system can support life. He does his floundering best to raise his son, Robin: “my sad, singular, newly turning nine-year-old, in trouble with this world”. Theo’s wife, Alyssa, died in a road accident when Robin was seven, and Bewilderment is among other things a triangular family romance.

Bewilderment channels both the cosmic sublime and that of the vast American outdoors

As father and son process their tragedy, the human species accelerates towards ecocide and self-ruination. The novel’s title is perfect: himself a cosmic orphan awed by astral immensities, Theo feels out of his depth as a parent (“I could no more raise a child than I could speak Swahili”), while recognising that his possibly autistic, bipolar or attention-deficit son is a rare and luminous being. A pocket moral absolute, Robin is incapable of knowing that countless species face extinction without devoting himself to resisting this death-drift. The tenderness and delicacy with which the father-son relationship is depicted repeatedly brought to my mind Cormac McCarthy’s The Road, though it is a pre-apocalyptic planet on which Theo and Robin struggle to find fortitude and hope. (Interestingly, Powers, who is in his 60s, is not a father.)

Among the novel’s many virtues is the mood it radiates of sheer cosmic awe. Robin worries himself into fits of agitation by asking the question posed in the Fermi paradox: seeing as the universe is incomprehensibly vast, why have we found no sure signs of intelligent life in its abyss? When Olaf Stapledon’s classic sci-fi novel of aeonic scope Star Maker is mentioned (“the Bible of my youth”), it is not unexpected. Richard Powers is coming to seem a gift to those of us who admire Stapledon’s genre but regret its indifference to human complexities. Impressively precise in its scientific conjectures, Bewilderment is no less rich or wise in its emotionality. Moreover, science fiction is not just a looming generic presence, but part of the novel’s narrative mechanism. In periodic, myth-like passages, Theo takes his son on inner voyages to fantastical alien worlds based on the deep space atmospheric models he creates at work.

Bewilderment channels both the cosmic sublime and that of the vast American outdoors, resting confidently in a lineage with Thoreau and Whitman, Dillard and Kerouac. It’s also a ghostly and affecting love story. Given the choice between putting his difficult son on meds to appease his school authorities and submitting him to experimental neuroscientific research involving emotional states transferred between human subjects, a disquieted Theo watches Alyssa’s resurrected personality merge with Robin’s. Spectral echoes of Solaris haunt these uncanny passages.

We are into the terrain here of myth, metaphysics and religion. Sorrowing awe is Bewilderment’s primary tone, and its many remarkable scenes are controlled with high novelistic intelligence. Robin is as compelling a fictional creation as I’ve encountered in some time – fierce, lovable and otherworldly. In dreaming him up, Powers was clearly working out a bold fictive question: what must it be like to father a Greta Thunberg? The penny dropped for me when “the world’s most famous 14-year-old” makes a cameo: Inga Alder, identical to Thunberg in all but name. A mesmerised Robin falls in love with her over TV and YouTube: “She’s like me, Dad.”

219,The Making of Incarnation by Tom McCarthy review – all work and no play,"Show caption Tom McCarthy: ‘boundary-pushing’. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian Fiction The Making of Incarnation by Tom McCarthy review – all work and no play Time-and-motion studies meets motion-capture acrobatics in a hi-tech saga that’s big on detail but devoid of insight Jonathan Myerson Sun 12 Sep 2021 13.00 BST Share on Facebook

After consecutive Booker shortlistings, Tom McCarthy’s reputation as a boundary-pushing novelist seems set. But, perhaps more than anything he’s written, this latest work tempts the question: what exactly does a novel have to offer the reader in order to be classified as such?

Structurally, it’s hard to quibble: The Making of Incarnation is multi-stranded in a tradition that goes back to Dickens. Monica Dean, a young lawyer, is at the LSE, researching the early history of time-and-motion studies – an anonymous client is interested in whether movements can be copyrighted. Mark Phocan is also at work: Pantarey is a motion-capture specialist company on the outskirts of Oxford, today enticing a couple to perform enthusiastic sex while plastered in digital markers. And Ben Briar has a new job as scientific adviser on the sci-fi blockbuster Incarnation.

Dean, like everyone else in the book, is only shown doing what she’s employed to do

From there, these strands plough forwards. Dean is sent to Indiana to the archives of Lillian Gilbreth – in the 1930s, she was one of the early pioneers of workplace engineering. In this retelling, she has catalogued her observations in 3D models, illustrating workers’ movements in miniaturised arcs, each reconstructed in a thousand numbered shoeboxes.

Meanwhile, Phocan is sent to Soho to start work on Incarnation – its invented far-galactic world may be a mumbo-jumbo of Athenian-cum-medieval vocabulary and swordplay, but his CGI must ensure that the light from the nearby nebula falls with Hawkingesque precision throughout the spaceship, most especially on the gravity-free copulation scene. There’s barely a page without something like “the accumulated data being fed into the gait lab’s server, amalgamated with cached readings from his previous two sessions and fed forward to the online cataloguing systems of CMAC and ESMAC...” At first, these incomprehensible paragraphs do generate a cutting-edge atmosphere, but they very soon merge into so much IT wallpaper.

Yet far from needing all this factuality, fiction thrives on unknowns – the actual one that drives the plot, and the psychological one, which will give it resonance beyond a mere story. So the upfront mystery kicks in when Dean unearths Gilbreth’s letter to a physicist in then-Soviet Lithuania: apparently, Box 808 “changes everything”, and may in fact encapsulate the “perfect movement”. Result! But Box 808 is missing from the shelves. And when she pushes, Dean’s library access is revoked; soon after, the client also terminates the contract.

McCarthy tells us nothing about the rest of Dean’s life, creates no narrative that might show us how this episode enlarges or diminishes her. The modern novel thrives on moments when an individual behaves out of character but Dean, like everyone else in the book, is only shown doing what she’s employed to do. So what, novelistically speaking, is in it for the reader?

Meanwhile, Phocan spends 23 pages watching a bobsleigh team make use of a digitised wind tunnel. Job done. He travels to a disused sardine factory in Norway to motion-capture an acrobatic team for Incarnation. Job done. And finally, he is sent to Riga to prise Box 808 from the aged Lithuanian physicist. Job not done, because the only tangible result is a less-profound-than-James-Bond coupling with the physicist’s granddaughter, followed by her grandfather’s suicide. Again, Phocan remains unchanged by these events.

But a novel must surely enable us to invest in the central characters’ aspirations or failings or loves and losses. In Remainder, McCarthy’s unforgettable breakthrough novel, the protagonist may be gripped by a Paul Austerish need to painstakingly restage a road accident but his obsession becomes the human enigma that resonates far beyond the mechanics. In this latest book, having lured us with work lives packed with IP, IT and CGI, he offers no enigma, no insight. We are left with what the characters are employed to do, nine to five, and little more. It’s minutely described and probably realistic, but is that a novel?

Using notes left by the founding father of “tartan noir” William McIlvanney (1936-2015), bestselling Scottish novelist Ian Rankin has completed a prequel to the author’s magnificent trilogy featuring police officer Jack Laidlaw. Set in Glasgow in 1972, The Dark Remains (Canongate, £20) is not so much an origin story – the bookish, thoughtful and often acerbic loner, blueprint for Inspector Rebus and many others, seems fully formed and entirely recognisable – as a homage. When lawyer Bobby Carter, right-hand man to gang boss Cam Colvin, is stabbed to death, the police are concerned that this may be the opening salvo in a turf war between the city’s criminal factions. Although a lowly DC, Laidlaw ignores the orders of his blundering superior and strikes out with his own investigation. Ever-changing loyalties and betrayals abound – not least Laidlaw’s selfish neglect of his wife and children – and although the denouement may be predictable, and Rankin’s prose might not quite match McIlvanney’s inimitable style, The Dark Remains is an immersive and satisfyingly pitch-black read.

Set in Sydney, the latest book from the bestselling Australian author Liane Moriarty, Apples Never Fall (Michael Joseph, £20), is an engrossing mashup of family drama and psychological suspense that offers a mystery – the disappearance of 69-year-old Joy Delaney on Valentine’s Day 2020 – then trawls back through the past half century to unravel it. The Delaneys are a tennis family: Stan and Joy met as champions and toured the circuit together before setting up an academy. Although their four children are good players and spent their formative years practising relentlessly, none had the precise combination of physical and psychological qualities that make a champion – unlike Stan’s star pupil, who seemed set to give the pair vicarious glory until he inexplicably jumped ship to another coach. Now retired, Stan and Joy find themselves rudderless, and when a young woman turns up on their doorstep, distressed, they allow her to move in – much to the dismay of their children, who soon begin to suspect that she is not, as she claims, a victim of domestic violence. This is a complex and satisfying tale of the sacrifices we make, the way we betray one another and the slippery nature of memory: perfect holiday reading.

The Rosebud Native American Reservation in South Dakota is the setting for a fascinating debut novel, Winter Counts (Simon & Schuster, £14.99) – the first in a projected series featuring vigilante-for-hire Virgil Wounded Horse – written by David Heska Wanbli Weiden, member of the Sicangu Lakota Nation. Struggling with issues of identity, Virgil acts on behalf of those failed by the unsatisfactory combination of toothless tribal police and a US criminal justice system that all too often declines to prosecute wrongdoers. But the professional becomes personal when his 14-year-old nephew Nathan almost dies from a heroin overdose. With the help of ex-girlfriend Marie Short Bear, Virgil is determined to prevent the influx of the drug into the community, but the cartels are powerful and such authority as he has is extremely limited. Winter Counts is both a solid take on a trope familiar to readers of crime and western genres – the lone man’s quest for justice – and an authentic and humane view of a largely unreported world, ravaged by years of systemic oppression.

For those old enough to remember, the fuzzy outlines of quite a few real people will be visible behind the fictional characters in Robert Peston’s first novel, The Whistleblower (Zaffre, £14.99), set during the run-up to the 1997 general election, when John Major’s Tory government was ousted by a Labour landslide. Central to the action here is Gil Peck who, like his creator, is a political and financial journalist who has OCD – although presumably that’s where the resemblance stops, as Peck is also unscrupulous, obsessive, addicted and careless of the feelings of others. When his estranged sister, a Treasury official, dies in an apparent road accident, he smells a rat, and the resulting investigation uncovers financial shenanigans and undue influence in high places. While it’s not hard to guess who dun what, this enjoyable, intelligent thriller will be catnip for news junkies.

Toshihiko Yahagi

The Wrong Goodbye (MacLehose, £18.99) is the first novel by Japanese bestseller Toshihiko Yahagi to be translated into English, by Alfred Birnbaum. It’s a self-styled homage to Raymond Chandler, set in and around the US naval base at the entrance to Tokyo Bay, featuring hard-drinking police officer Eiji Futamura. His chance meeting with American pilot Billy Lou Bonney kicks off a sequence of events – dead and missing women, black marketeers, former Vietcong moles, triads – that have their roots in the Vietnam war. A clear indication of exactly when the book is set – around 2000, according to my arithmetic – would have removed an unnecessary layer of confusion from this complex, atmospheric thriller.","['set', 'virgil', 'crime', 'roundup', 'joy', 'laidlaw', 'remains', 'rankin', 'recent', 'thrillers', 'winter', 'featuring', 'novel', 'best', 'review', 'ian']","Show caption Prequel time for Jack Laidlaw … Ian Rankin.

STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a civilian police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were traveling, news media said.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist’s partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Muhammad drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle. He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

Vilks’ life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Al-Qaida put a bounty on Vilks’ head. In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden. Last year, a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.","['artist', 'dogs', 'protection', 'media', 'road', 'reportedly', 'sweden', 'threatened', 'vilks', 'muhammad', 'sketch', 'prophet', 'dead', 'swedish', 'accident']","Swedish artist Lars Vilks at his home outside Hoganas in Sweden, Sunday May 16, 2010.

223,Lars Vilks: Swede who lived under police protection after drawing Prophet Muhammad dies in crash,"The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, known for his 2007 drawing of the Prophet Muhammad and the subsequent death threats that followed, died in a car crash on Sunday.

Vilks, who was largely unknown outside of Sweden before his Muhammad drawing, had been living under police protection since 2007.

The drawing of Muhammand with a dog’s body led to a number of plots against him, and Al-Qaida put a bounty on his head.

In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden.

In 2015 he escaped unscathed in Copenhagen from an attack during a debate on Islamism and freedom of expression following the Charlie Hebdo massacre

Last year, a woman from Pennsylvania in the US pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.

Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Police said Vilks, 75, died alongside two of his bodyguards in a road accident.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks insisted he was not a racist and didn’t have a political position, but wanted to probe the limits of what we can and cannot do.

""I think it's very important, if you want to talk about freedom of expression and Islam and Muslims, to have a real position, to have something provocative and transgressive enough to start a debate,” he said.

On the day of the attack on Charlie Hebdo, Lars Vilks confided his sadness to the regional newspaper Helsingborgs Dagblad. ""We cannot give up on freedom of expression. The attack in Paris is unfortunately significant of the times we live in.”

A month later, on 14 February, a young Danish man of Palestinian origin tried to barge into a debate on freedom of expression organised in Copenhagen in response to the Charlie Hebdo massacre.

Vilks, the headliner of the meeting with the French ambassador, escaped unharmed, but a 55-year-old Danish film director was killed.

The assailant then managed to kill a Jewish security guard outside the Copenhagen synagogue, before being shot dead in a stand-off with Danish police.","['attack', 'expression', 'swede', 'protection', 'lived', 'dies', 'muhammad', 'debate', 'vilks', 'charlie', 'lars', 'drawing', 'crash', 'prophet', 'freedom', 'danish', 'copenhagen', 'hebdo']","The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, known for his 2007 drawing of the Prophet Muhammad and the subsequent death threats that followed, died in a car crash on Sunday.

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

Yeah-yeah, the cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so be merciful and give the cars some space to grow :D

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The genetic algorithm for this project is implemented in TypeScript. The full genetic source code will be shown in this article, but you may also find the final code examples in the Evolution Simulator repository.

We're going to use a genetic algorithm for the particular task of evolving cars' genomes. However, this article only touches on the basics of the algorithm and is by no means a complete guide to the genetic algorithm topic.

Having that said, let's deep dive into more details...

The Plan

Step-by-step we're going to break down a high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 bits (finding the optimal car genome).

Here is what we're going to do:

💪🏻 Give the muscles (engine, steering wheel) to the car so that it could move towards the parking spot. 👀 Give the eyes (sensors) to the car so that it could see the obstacles around. 🧠 Give the brain to the car that will control the muscles (movements) based on what the car sees (obstacles via sensors). The brain will be simply a pure function movements = f(sensors) . 🧬 Evolve the brain to do the right moves based on the sensors input. This is where we will apply a genetic algorithm. Generation after generation our brain function movements = f(sensors) will learn how to move the car towards the parking spot.

Giving the muscles to the car

To be able to move, the car would need ""muscles"". Let's give the car two types of muscles:

Engine muscle - allows the car to move ↓ back, ↑ forth, or ◎ stand steel (neutral gear) Steering wheel muscle - allows the car to turn ← left, → right, or ◎ go straight while moving

With these two muscles the car can perform the following movements:

In our case, the muscles are receivers of the signals that come from the brain once every 100ms (milliseconds). Based on the value of the brain's signal the muscles act differently. We'll cover the ""brain"" part below, but for now, let's say that our brain may send only 3 possible signals to each muscle: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

type MuscleSignal = - 1 | 0 | 1 ;

For example, the brain may send the signal with the value of +1 to the engine muscle and it will start moving the car forward. The signal -1 to the engine moves the car backward. At the same time, if the brain will send the signal of -1 to the steering wheel muscle, it will turn the car to the left, etc.

Here is how the brain signal values map to the muscle actions in our case:

Muscle Signal = -1 Signal = 0 Signal = +1 Engine ↓ Backward ◎ Neutral ↑ Forward Steering wheel ← Left ◎ Straight → Right

You may use the Evolution Simulator and try to park the car manually to see how the car muscles work. Every time you press one of the WASD keyboard keys (or use a touch-screen joystick) you send these -1 , 0 , or +1 signals to the engine and steering wheel muscles.

Giving the eyes to the car

Before our car will learn how to do self-parking using its muscles, it needs to be able to ""see"" the surroundings. Let's give it the 8 eyes in a form of distance sensors:

Each sensor can detect the obstacle in a distance range of 0-4m (meters).

(meters). Each sensor reports the latest information about the obstacles it ""sees"" to the car's ""brain"" every 100ms .

. Whenever the sensor doesn't see any obstacles it reports the value of 0 . On the contrary, if the value of the sensor is small but not zero (i.e. 0.01m ) it would mean that the obstacle is close.

You may use the Evolution Simulator and see how the color of each sensor changes based on how close the obstacle is.

type Sensors = number [ ] ;

Giving the brain to the car

At this moment, our car can ""see"" and ""move"", but there is no ""coordinator"", that would transform the signals from the ""eyes"" to the proper movements of the ""muscles"". We need to give the car a ""brain"".

Brain input

As an input from the sensors, every 100ms the brain will be getting 8 float numbers, each one in range of [0...4] . For example, the input might look like this:

const sensors : Sensors = [ s0 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 , s7 ] ;

Brain output

Every 100ms the brain should produce two integers as an output:

One number as a signal for the engine: engineSignal One number as a signal for the steering wheel: wheelSignal

Each number should be of the type MuscleSignal and might take one of three values: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

Brain formulas/functions

Keeping in mind the brain's input and output mentioned above we may say that the brain is just a function:

const { engineSignal , wheelSignal } = brainToMuscleSignal ( brainFunction ( sensors ) ) ;

Where brainToMuscleSignal() is a function that converts raw brain signals (any float number) to muscle signals (to -1 , 0 , or +1 number) so that muscles could understand it. We'll implement this converter function below.

The main question now is what kind of a function the brainFunction() is.

To make the car smarter and its movements to be more sophisticated we could go with a Multilayer Perceptron. The name is a bit scary but this is a simple Neural Network with a basic architecture (think of it as a big formula with many parameters/coefficients).

I've covered Multilayer Perceptrons with a bit more details in my homemade-machine-learning, machine-learning-experiments, and nano-neuron projects. You may even challenge that simple network to recognize your written digits.

However, to avoid the introduction of a whole new concept of Neural Networks, we'll go with a much simpler approach and we'll use two Linear Polynomials with multiple variables (to be more precise, each polynomial will have exactly 8 variables, since we have 8 sensors) which will look something like this:

engineSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( e0 * s0 ) + ( e1 * s1 ) + ... + ( e7 * s7 ) + e8 ) wheelSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( w0 * s0 ) + ( w1 * s1 ) + ... + ( w7 * s7 ) + w8 )

Where:

[s0, s1, ..., s7] - the 8 variables, which are the 8 sensor values. These are dynamic.

- the variables, which are the sensor values. These are dynamic. [e0, e1, ..., e8] - the 9 coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static.

- the coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static. [w0, w1, ..., w8] - the 9 coefficients for the steering wheel polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static

The cost of using the simpler function for the brain will be that the car won't be able to learn some sophisticated moves and also won't be able to generalize well and adapt well to unknown surroundings. But for our particular parking lot and for the sake of demonstrating the work of a genetic algorithm it should still be enough.

We may implement the generic polynomial function in the following way:

type Coefficients = number [ ] ; const linearPolynomial = ( coefficients : Coefficients , variables : number [ ] ) : number => { if ( coefficients . length !== ( variables . length + 1 ) ) { throw new Error ( 'Incompatible number of polynomial coefficients and variables' ) ; } let result = 0 ; coefficients . forEach ( ( coefficient : number , coefficientIndex : number ) => { if ( coefficientIndex < variables . length ) { result += coefficient * variables [ coefficientIndex ] ; } else { result += coefficient } } ) ; return result ; } ;

The car's brain in this case will consist of two polynomials and will look like this:

const engineSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( engineCoefficients , sensors ) ) ; const wheelSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( wheelCoefficients , sensors ) ) ;

The output of a linearPolynomial() function is a float number. The brainToMuscleSignal() function need to convert the wide range of floats to three particular integers, and it will do it in two steps:

Convert the float of a wide range (i.e. 0.456 or 3673.45 or -280 ) to the float in a range of (0...1) (i.e. 0.05 or 0.86 ) Convert the float in a range of (0...1) to one of three integer values of -1 , 0 , or +1 . For example, the floats that are close to 0 will be converted to -1 , the floats that are close to 0.5 will be converted to 0 , and the floats that are close to 1 will be converted to 1 .

To do the first part of the conversion we need to introduce a Sigmoid Function which implements the following formula:

It converts the wide range of floats (the x axis) to float numbers with a limited range of (0...1) (the y axis). This is exactly what we need.

Here is how the conversion steps would look on the Sigmoid graph.

The implementation of two conversion steps mentioned above would look like this:

const sigmoid = ( x : number ) : number => { return 1 / ( 1 + Math . E ** - x ) ; } ; const sigmoidToMuscleSignal = ( sigmoidValue : number , margin : number = 0.4 ) : MuscleSignal => { if ( sigmoidValue < ( 0.5 - margin ) ) { return - 1 ; } if ( sigmoidValue > ( 0.5 + margin ) ) { return 1 ; } return 0 ; } ; const brainToMuscleSignal = ( rawBrainSignal : number ) : MuscleSignal => { const normalizedBrainSignal = sigmoid ( rawBrainSignal ) ; return sigmoidToMuscleSignal ( normalizedBrainSignal ) ; }

Car's genome (DNA)

☝🏻 The main conclusion from the ""Eyes"", ""Muscles"" and ""Brain"" sections above should be this: the coefficients [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] defines the behavior of the car. These 18 numbers together form the unique car's Genome (or car's DNA).

Car genome in a decimal form

Let's join the [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] brain coefficients together to form a car's genome in a decimal form:

const carGenomeBase10 = [ e0 , e1 , ... , e8 , w0 , w1 , ... , w8 ] ;

Car genome in a binary form

Let's move one step deeper (to the level of the genes) and convert the decimal numbers of the car's genome to the binary format (to the plain 1 s and 0 s).

I've described in the detail the process of converting the floating-point numbers to binary numbers in the Binary representation of the floating-point numbers article. You might want to check it out if the code in this section is not clear.

Here is a quick example of how the floating-point number may be converted to the 16 bits binary number (again, feel free to read this first if the example is confusing):

In our case, to reduce the genome length, we will convert each floating coefficient to the non-standard 10 bits binary number ( 1 sign bit, 4 exponent bits, 5 fraction bits).

We have 18 coefficients in total, every coefficient will be converted to 10 bits number. It means that the car's genome will be an array of 0 s and 1 s with a length of 18 * 10 = 180 bits .

For example, for the genome in a decimal format that was mentioned above, its binary representation would look like this:

type Gene = 0 | 1 ; type Genome = Gene [ ] ; const genome : Genome = [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , ] ;

Oh my! The binary genome looks so cryptic. But can you imagine, that these 180 zeroes and ones alone define how the car behaves in the parking lot! It's like you hacked someone's DNA and know what each gene means exactly. Amazing!

By the way, you may see the exact values of genomes and coefficients for the best performing car on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Here is the source code that performs the conversion from binary to decimal format for the floating-point numbers (the brain will need it to decode the genome and to produce the muscle signals based on the genome data):

type Bit = 0 | 1 ; type Bits = Bit [ ] ; type PrecisionConfig = { signBitsCount : number , exponentBitsCount : number , fractionBitsCount : number , totalBitsCount : number , } ; type PrecisionConfigs = { custom : PrecisionConfig , } ; const precisionConfigs : PrecisionConfigs = { custom : { signBitsCount : 1 , exponentBitsCount : 4 , fractionBitsCount : 5 , totalBitsCount : 10 , } , } ; function bitsToFloat ( bits : Bits , precisionConfig : PrecisionConfig ) : number { const { signBitsCount , exponentBitsCount } = precisionConfig ; const sign = ( - 1 ) ** bits [ 0 ] ; const exponentBias = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - 1 ) - 1 ; const exponentBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount , signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const exponentUnbiased = exponentBits . reduce ( ( exponentSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - bitIndex - 1 ) ; return exponentSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; const exponent = exponentUnbiased - exponentBias ; const fractionBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const fraction = fractionBits . reduce ( ( fractionSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** - ( bitIndex + 1 ) ; return fractionSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; return sign * ( 2 ** exponent ) * ( 1 + fraction ) ; } function bitsToFloat10 ( bits : Bits ) : number { return bitsToFloat ( bits , precisionConfigs . custom ) ; }

Brain function working with binary genome

Previously our brain function was working with the decimal form of engineCoefficients and wheelCoefficients polynomial coefficients directly. However, these coefficients are now encoded in the binary form of a genome. Let's add a decodeGenome() function that will extract coefficients from the genome and let's rewrite our brain functions:

const CAR_SENSORS_NUM = 8 ; const BIAS_UNITS = 1 ; const GENES_PER_NUMBER = precisionConfigs . custom . totalBitsCount ; const ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const GENOME_LENGTH = ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ; type DecodedGenome = { engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , } const genomeToNumbers = ( genome : Genome , genesPerNumber : number ) : number [ ] => { if ( genome . length % genesPerNumber !== 0 ) { throw new Error ( 'Wrong number of genes in the numbers genome' ) ; } const numbers : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let numberIndex = 0 ; numberIndex < genome . length ; numberIndex += genesPerNumber ) { const number : number = bitsToFloat10 ( genome . slice ( numberIndex , numberIndex + genesPerNumber ) ) ; numbers . push ( number ) ; } return numbers ; } ; const decodeGenome = ( genome : Genome ) : DecodedGenome => { const engineGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( 0 , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ) ; const wheelsGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ) ; const engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( engineGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; const wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( wheelsGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; return { engineFormulaCoefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients , } ; } ; export const getEngineMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { engineFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ; export const getWheelsMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { wheelsFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ;

Self-driving car problem statement

☝🏻 So, finally, we've got to the point when the high-level problem of making the car to be a self-parking car is broken down to the straightforward optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeros (finding the ""good enough"" car's genome). Sounds simple, doesn't it?

Naive approach

We could approach the problem of finding the ""good enough"" genome in a naive way and try out all possible combinations of genes:

[0, ..., 0, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 0, 1] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 1] , and then... ...

But, let's do some math. With 180 bits and with each bit being equal either to 0 or to 1 we would have 2^180 (or 1.53 * 10^54 ) possible combinations. Let's say we would need to give 15s to each car to see if it will park successfully or not. Let's also say that we may run a simulation for 10 cars at once. Then we would need 15 * (1.53 * 10^54) / 10 = 2.29 * 10^54 [seconds] which is 7.36 * 10^46 [years] . Pretty long waiting time. Just as a side thought, it is only 2.021 * 10^3 [years] that have passed after Christ was born.

Genetic approach

We need a faster algorithm to find the optimal value of the genome. This is where the genetic algorithm comes to the rescue. We might not find the best value of the genome, but there is a chance that we may find the optimal value of it. And, what is, more importantly, we don't need to wait that long. With the Evolution Simulator I was able to find a pretty good genome within 24 [hours] .

Genetic algorithm basics

A genetic algorithms (GA) inspired by the process of natural selection, and are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as crossover, mutation and selection.

The problem of finding the ""good enough"" combination of genes for the car looks like an optimization problem, so there is a good chance that GA will help us here.

We're not going to cover a genetic algorithm in all details, but on a high level here are the basic steps that we will need to do:

CREATE – the very first generation of cars can't come out of nothing, so we will generate a set of random car genomes (set of binary arrays with the length of 180 ) at the very beginning. For example, we may create ~1000 cars. With a bigger population the chances to find the optimal solution (and to find it faster) increase. SELECT - we will need to select the fittest individuums out of the current generation for further mating (see the next step). The fitness of each individuum will be defined based on the fitness function, which in our case, will show how close the car approached the target parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. MATE – simply saying we will allow the selected ""♂ father-cars"" to have ""sex"" with the selected ""♀ mother-cars"" so that their genomes could mix in a ~50/50 proportion and produce ""♂♀ children-cars"" genomes. The idea is that the children cars might get better (or worse) in self-parking, by taking the best (or the worst) bits from their parents. MUTATE - during the mating process some genes may randomly mutate ( 1 s and 0 s in child genome may flip). This may bring a wider variety of children genomes and, thus, a wider variety of children cars behavior. Imagine that the 1st bit was accidentally set to 0 for all ~1000 cars. The only way to try the car with the 1st bit being set to 1 is through the random mutations. At the same time, extensive mutations may ruin healthy genomes. Go to ""Step 2"" unless the number of generations has reached the limit (i.e. 100 generations have passed) or unless the top-performing individuums have reached the expected fitness function value (i.e. the best car has approached the parking spot closer than 1 meter ). Otherwise, quit.

Evolving the car's brain using a Genetic Algorithm

Before launching the genetic algorithm let's go and create the functions for the ""CREATE"", ""SELECT"", ""MATE"" and ""MUTATE"" steps of the algorithm.

Functions for the CREATE step

The createGeneration() function will create an array of random genomes (a.k.a. population or generation) and will accept two parameters:

generationSize - defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation.

- defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation. genomeLength - defines the genome length of each individuum in the cars population. In our case, the length of the genome will be 180 .

There is a 50/50 chance for each gene of a genome to be either 0 or 1 .

type Generation = Genome [ ] ; type GenerationParams = { generationSize : number , genomeLength : number , } ; function createGenome ( length : number ) : Genome { return new Array ( length ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? 0 : 1 ) ) ; } function createGeneration ( params : GenerationParams ) : Generation { const { generationSize , genomeLength } = params ; return new Array ( generationSize ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => createGenome ( genomeLength ) ) ; }

Functions for the MUTATE step

The mutate() function will mutate some genes randomly based on the mutationProbability value.

For example, if the mutationProbability = 0.1 then there is a 10% chance for each genome to be mutated. Let's say if we would have a genome of length 10 that looks like [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] , then after the mutation, there will be a chance that 1 gene will be mutated and we may get a genome that might look like [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] .

type Probability = number ; function mutate ( genome : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability ) : Genome { for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < genome . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { const gene : Gene = genome [ geneIndex ] ; const mutatedGene : Gene = gene === 0 ? 1 : 0 ; genome [ geneIndex ] = Math . random ( ) < mutationProbability ? mutatedGene : gene ; } return genome ; }

Functions for the MATE step

The mate() function will accept the father and the mother genomes and will produce two children. We will imitate the real-world scenario and also do the mutation during the mating.

Each bit of the child genome will be defined based on the values of the correspondent bit of the father's or mother's genomes. There is a 50/50% probability that the child will inherit the bit of the father or the mother. For example, let's say we have genomes of length 4 (for simplicity reasons):

Father's genome: [0, 0, 1, 1] Mother's genome: [0, 1, 0, 1] ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ Possible kid #1: [0, 1, 1, 1] Possible kid #2: [0, 0, 1, 1]

In the example above the mutation were not taken into account.

Here is the function implementation:

function mate ( father : Genome , mother : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability , ) : [ Genome , Genome ] { if ( father . length !== mother . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Cannot mate different species' ) ; } const firstChild : Genome = [ ] ; const secondChild : Genome = [ ] ; for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < father . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { firstChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; secondChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; } return [ mutate ( firstChild , mutationProbability ) , mutate ( secondChild , mutationProbability ) , ] ; }

Functions for the SELECT step

To select the fittest individuums for further mating we need a way to find out the fitness of each genome. To do this we will use a so-called fitness function.

The fitness function is always related to the particular task that we try to solve, and it is not generic. In our case, the fitness function will measure the distance between the car and the parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. We will implement the fitness function a bit later, but for now, let's introduce the interface for it:

type FitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) => number ;

Now, let's say we have fitness values for each individuum in the population. Let's also say that we sorted all individuums by their fitness values so that the first individuums are the strongest ones. How should we select the fathers and the mothers from this array? We need to do the selection in a way, that the higher the fitness value of the individuum, the higher the chances of this individuum being selected for mating. The weightedRandom() function will help us with this.

const weightedRandom = < T > ( items : T [ ] , weights : number [ ] ) : { item : T , index : number } => { if ( items . length !== weights . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Items and weights must be of the same size' ) ; } const cumulativeWeights : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < weights . length ; i += 1 ) { cumulativeWeights [ i ] = weights [ i ] + ( cumulativeWeights [ i - 1 ] || 0 ) ; } const maxCumulativeWeight = cumulativeWeights [ cumulativeWeights . length - 1 ] ; const randomNumber = maxCumulativeWeight * Math . random ( ) ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < items . length ; i += 1 ) { if ( cumulativeWeights [ i ] >= randomNumber ) { return { item : items [ i ] , index : i , } ; } } return { item : items [ items . length - 1 ] , index : items . length - 1 , } ; } ;

The usage of this function is pretty straightforward. Let's say you really like bananas and want to eat them more often than strawberries. Then you may call const fruit = weightedRandom(['banana', 'strawberry'], [9, 1]) , and in ≈9 out of 10 cases the fruit variable will be equal to banana , and only in ≈1 out of 10 times it will be equal to strawberry .

To avoid losing the best individuums (let's call them champions) during the mating process we may also introduce a so-called longLivingChampionsPercentage parameter. For example, if the longLivingChampionsPercentage = 10 , then 10% of the best cars from the previous population will be carried over to the new generation. You may think about it as there are some long-living individuums that can live a long life and see their children and even grandchildren.

Here is the actual implementation of the select() function:

type Percentage = number ; type SelectionOptions = { mutationProbability : Probability , longLivingChampionsPercentage : Percentage , } ; function select ( generation : Generation , fitness : FitnessFunction , options : SelectionOptions , ) { const { mutationProbability , longLivingChampionsPercentage , } = options ; const newGeneration : Generation = [ ] ; const oldGeneration = [ ... generation ] ; oldGeneration . sort ( ( genomeA : Genome , genomeB : Genome ) : number => { const fitnessA = fitness ( genomeA ) ; const fitnessB = fitness ( genomeB ) ; if ( fitnessA < fitnessB ) { return 1 ; } if ( fitnessA > fitnessB ) { return - 1 ; } return 0 ; } ) ; const longLiversCount = Math . floor ( longLivingChampionsPercentage * oldGeneration . length / 100 ) ; if ( longLiversCount ) { oldGeneration . slice ( 0 , longLiversCount ) . forEach ( ( longLivingGenome : Genome ) => { newGeneration . push ( longLivingGenome ) ; } ) ; } const fitnessPerOldGenome : number [ ] = oldGeneration . map ( ( genome : Genome ) => fitness ( genome ) ) ; while ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { let father : Genome | null = null ; let fatherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; let mother : Genome | null = null ; let matherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; while ( ! father || ! mother || fatherGenomeIndex === matherGenomeIndex ) { const { item : randomFather , index : randomFatherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; const { item : randomMother , index : randomMotherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; father = randomFather ; fatherGenomeIndex = randomFatherGenomeIndex ; mother = randomMother ; matherGenomeIndex = randomMotherGenomeIndex ; } const [ firstChild , secondChild ] = mate ( father , mother , mutationProbability ) ; newGeneration . push ( firstChild ) ; if ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { newGeneration . push ( secondChild ) ; } } return newGeneration ; }

Fitness function

The fitness of the car will be defined by the distance from the car to the parking spot. The higher the distance, the lower the fitness.

The final distance we will calculate is an average distance from 4 car wheels to the correspondent 4 corners of the parking spot. This distance we will call the loss which is inversely proportional to the fitness .

Calculating the distance between each wheel and each corner separately (instead of just calculating the distance from the car center to the parking spot center) will make the car preserve the proper orientation relative to the parking spot.

The distance between two points in space will be calculated based on the Pythagorean theorem like this:

type NumVec3 = [ number , number , number ] ; const euclideanDistance = ( from : NumVec3 , to : NumVec3 ) => { const fromX = from [ 0 ] ; const fromZ = from [ 2 ] ; const toX = to [ 0 ] ; const toZ = to [ 2 ] ; return Math . sqrt ( ( fromX - toX ) ** 2 + ( fromZ - toZ ) ** 2 ) ; } ;

The distance (the loss ) between the car and the parking spot will be calculated like this:

type RectanglePoints = { fl : NumVec3 , fr : NumVec3 , bl : NumVec3 , br : NumVec3 , } ; type GeometricParams = { wheelsPosition : RectanglePoints , parkingLotCorners : RectanglePoints , } ; const carLoss = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const { wheelsPosition , parkingLotCorners } = params ; const { fl : flWheel , fr : frWheel , br : brWheel , bl : blWheel , } = wheelsPosition ; const { fl : flCorner , fr : frCorner , br : brCorner , bl : blCorner , } = parkingLotCorners ; const flDistance = euclideanDistance ( flWheel , flCorner ) ; const frDistance = euclideanDistance ( frWheel , frCorner ) ; const brDistance = euclideanDistance ( brWheel , brCorner ) ; const blDistance = euclideanDistance ( blWheel , blCorner ) ; return ( flDistance + frDistance + brDistance + blDistance ) / 4 ; } ;

Since the fitness should be inversely proportional to the loss we'll calculate it like this:

const carFitness = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const loss = carLoss ( params ) ; return 1 / ( loss + 1 ) ; } ;

You may see the fitness and the loss values for a specific genome and for a current car position on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Launching the evolution

Let's put the evolution functions together. We're going to ""create the world"", launch the evolution loop, make the time going, the generation evolving, and the cars learning how to park.

To get the fitness values of each car we need to run a simulation of the cars behavior in a virtual 3D world. The Evolution Simulator does exactly that - it runs the code below in the simulator, which is made with Three.js:

const GENERATION_SIZE = 1000 ; const LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE = 6 ; const MUTATION_PROBABILITY = 0.04 ; const MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM = 40 ; const carFitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) : number => { const genomeKey = genome . join ( '' ) ; return fitnessValues [ genomeKey ] ; } ; let generationIndex = 0 ; let generation : Generation = createGeneration ( { generationSize : GENERATION_SIZE , genomeLength : GENOME_LENGTH , } ) ; while ( generationIndex < MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM ) { generation = select ( generation , carFitnessFunction , { mutationProbability : MUTATION_PROBABILITY , longLivingChampionsPercentage : LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE , } , ) ; generationIndex += 1 ; } const fittestCar = generation [ 0 ] ;

After running the select() function, the generation array is sorted by the fitness values in descending order. Therefore, the fittest car will always be the first car in the array.

The 1st generation of cars with random genomes will behave something like this:

On the ≈40th generation the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot:

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

The cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so you may give the cars some more time to learn.

From generation to generation we may see how the loss values are going down (which means that fitness values are going up). The P50 Avg Loss shows the average loss value (average distance from the cars to the parking spot) of the 50% of fittest cars. The Min Loss shows the loss value of the fittest car in each generation.

You may see that on average the 50% of the fittest cars of the generation are learning to get closer to the parking spot (from 5.5m away from the parking spot to 3.5m in 35 generations). The trend for the Min Loss values is less obvious (from 1m to 0.5m with some noise signals), however from the animations above you may see that cars have learned some basic parking moves.

Conclusion

In this article, we've broken down the high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level task of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeroes (finding the optimal car genome).

Then we've applied the genetic algorithm to find the optimal car genome. It allowed us to get pretty good results in several hours of simulation (instead of many years of running the naive approach).

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The full genetic source code that was shown in this article may also be found in the Evolution Simulator repository. If you are one of those folks who will actually count and check the number of lines to make sure there are less than 500 of them (excluding tests), please feel free to check the code here 🥸.

There are still some unresolved issues with the code and the simulator:

The car's brain is oversimplified and it uses linear equations instead of, let's say, neural networks. It makes the car not adaptable to the new surroundings or to the new parking lot types.

We don't decrease the car's fitness value when the car is hitting the other car. Therefore the car doesn't ""feel"" any guilt in creating the road accident.

The evolution simulator is not stable. It means that the same car genome may produce different fitness values, which makes the evolution less efficient.

The evolution simulator is also very heavy in terms of performance, which slows down the evolution progress since we can't train, let's say, 1000 cars at once.

Also the Evolution Simulator requires the browser tab to be open and active to perform the simulation.

and more...

However, the purpose of this article was to have some fun while learning how the genetic algorithm works and not to build a production-ready self-parking Teslas. So, even with the issues mentioned above, I hope you've had a good time going through the article.","['generation', 'brain', '500', 'lines', 'const', 'length', 'function', 'car', 'genome', 'code', 'cars', 'return', 'number', 'selfparking']","Self-Parking Car in 500 Lines of Code28 September, 2021 15 min to readIn this article, we'll train the car to do self-parking using a genetic algorithm.

227,Swedish artist under police protection dies in road accident,"Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, has died in a traffic accident, police said. He was 75.

Vilks and two plainclothes police bodyguards were killed in a head-on crash with a truck on Sunday afternoon, said Carina Persson, police chief for southern Sweden.

She said the police car veered into the path of the truck and both vehicles burst into flames. The truck driver was flown to a hospital with serious injuries.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before 2007, when he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

There were a number of attempts on his life over the years.

Police said at this time they did not know why the car drove into the wrong lane but they were investigating whether a tire might have exploded.","['yearspolice', '2007', 'wrong', 'artist', 'dogs', 'protection', 'dies', 'road', 'muhammad', 'car', 'body', 'truck', 'sketch', 'prophet', 'swedish', 'accident']","Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, has died in a traffic accident, police said.

228,Threatened Swedish artist reportedly dead in road accident,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a civilian police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were traveling, news media said.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist's partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Muhammad drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle. He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

Vilks’ life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Al-Qaida put a bounty on Vilks' head. In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden. Last year, a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.","['traveling', 'sculpture', 'artist', 'dogs', 'road', 'reportedly', 'sweden', 'threatened', 'vilks', 'muhammad', 'southern', 'sketch', 'dead', 'swedish', 'accident']","STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

232,Sabah health director lodges police report against woman over 'aggressive' behaviour,"KOTA KINABALU: Sabah Health Director Dr Rose Nani Mudin says she filed a police report against a woman several days after a road accident due to her allegedly aggressive behaviour.

Dr Rose Nani said she had called the police to her office on Monday (Oct 4) after the woman, who goes by the name Shima on social media, came to her office building to look for her.

She added that a report was lodged as she feared for her safety and that of her staff.

In a statement, she explained that the accident occurred near the city at about 9.55pm on Sept 27 when she was on the way home from work.

Dr Rose Nani said she followed the necessary procedure, which was to lodge a police report and then let her insurance company follow up.

She said that on Sept 28, the woman came to her office to make several claims from her staff over the accident.

Her staff told Shima that the matter would be handled by the insurance company and advised her to refer to it for further details.

On Monday, Shima reportedly went to the director’s office again to meet her but Dr Rose Nani was in a meeting.

“I was told that she was aggressive and that was why I decided to lodge a police report,"" Dr Rose Nani said.

Shima also took to social media to complain about the way things were handled, saying she only wanted to meet Dr Rose Nani to settle some matters regarding the accident.

Kota Kinabalu acting police chief Supt George Rakman said the matter was a simple traffic case and as in most situations, the parties involved would need to go to a police station to lodge a report.

From there, statements would be taken and the one in the wrong would have to inform their insurance company for repair and claims purposes.

“Everything will be handled by the insurance company. There is no need for the parties involved in the accident to meet,” he said.

He added that police would not be filing criminal charges against anyone as yet.","['health', 'director', 'meet', 'shima', 'office', 'report', 'insurance', 'aggressive', 'woman', 'dr', 'behaviour', 'nani', 'lodges', 'rose', 'company', 'sabah']","KOTA KINABALU: Sabah Health Director Dr Rose Nani Mudin says she filed a police report against a woman several days after a road accident due to her allegedly aggressive behaviour.

233,Construction worker killed after row with friend,"GEORGE TOWN: A 52-year-old construction worker has allegedly been killed by his friend after a heated argument.

George Town OCPD Asst Comm Soffian Santong said police received a distress call at 2.30pm on Friday (Sept 24).

“We were told there was a fatal road accident at Changkat Minden Height, Gelugor.

“Based on the information given, police immediately went to the scene.

“However, investigations at the scene found that there were no elements of a road accident.

“The police team suspected foul play and that a crime had been committed,” he said.

ACP Soffian added that after the North-East District crime investigation team arrived at the scene and did a preliminary examination, they suspected that the victim had been beaten up.

From interviews with witnesses, he said, they gathered that a 42-year-old suspect had fought with the victim.

“The suspect claimed that the victim said rude things to him,"" ACP Soffian said, adding that this resulted in the suspect beating up the victim.

“Further investigations revealed that the victim was initially lying next to his motorcycle and a witness shifted his body to try and resuscitate him, but failed to do so.

“The forensics team did not find any weapons used during the fight.

“However, there were bruises on the victim’s forehead and a small cut near his right eye.

“The victim will be taken to the hospital for a post-mortem to determine the actual cause of death,” he said.

He added that the case is being investigated under Section 302 of the Penal Code for murder, which carries the death penalty upon conviction.

“We have identified the suspect and investigations are still ongoing.

“We hope that members of the public with information about the incident will come forward to the nearest police station to facilitate investigations.

234,HR Ministry to table proposal to provide free Socso protection for 2 million B40 housewives,"KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): The Human Resources Ministry through the Social Security Organisation (Socso) and Women, Family and Community Development Ministry (KWPKM) will propose to the Cabinet to provide free Socso protection for about two million B40 housewives nationwide.

Minister Datuk Seri M. Saravanan (pic) said following discussions, the ministry saw the need to protect the group who had been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, especially when husbands as the family’s breadwinner, could not go out to work.

""However, this will depend on the government's financial position... in this pandemic situation, if the husband is out of work and the wife has some chronic illness, they have no safety net.

""As a government that cares and prioritises the people’s welfare, we recommend that this move be considered to provide two million B40 housewives with a free safety net protection,"" he said after presenting Socso’s benefits to the widow of the late Vijaya Kumaran T. Veerasamy here today.

Vijaya Kumaran died on May 21 after suffering brain damage following a road accident on April 12, last year.

Prior to this, the deceased's medical treatment, which included an implant surgery amounting to RM23,000, was fully paid by Socso.

Earlier the government had agreed to make contribution payments to some 150,000 women in the B40 group registered under e-Kasih.

Meanwhile, on labour shortage in the plantation sector, Saravanan said, currently the country needed 100,000 workers in the sector but the ministry would continue to give priority to locals to fill the job vacancies.

""Foreign workers will be hired as a last resort,” he said adding that priority would continue to be given to locals, despite pressure from the plantation sector employers and the fact that this could affect national income. - Bernama","['safety', 'sector', 'proposal', 'protection', 'table', 'million', 'b40', 'ministry', 'women', 'saravanan', 'workers', 'socso', 'free', 'housewives', 'provide', 'hr']","KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama): The Human Resources Ministry through the Social Security Organisation (Socso) and Women, Family and Community Development Ministry (KWPKM) will propose to the Cabinet to provide free Socso protection for about two million B40 housewives nationwide.

235,"Denying driving licences to senior citizens would be a last resort, says Transport Minister","PETALING JAYA: Senior citizens will be issued driving licences if they are able to operate a vehicle and denying one would be a last resort measure, says Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong (pic).

""Retracting or limiting senior citizens to driving licences should be a last resort once it is proven they are unable to drive,” said the Transport Minister.

He said the issue needed a broader and more holistic view instead of focusing on age alone.

""The suggestion to limit motor vehicle licences (LKM) to senior citizens can also result in them only having to borrow another person's vehicle to bypass the law,"" said Dr Wee in a Facebook video on Saturday (Sept 25).

""Referring to isolated incidents or evaluating an individual based on their age would be discriminatory.

""There are also many drivers aged 70 and above who display better driving proficiency than younger drivers,"" he said.

He added that it was also the responsibility of individuals whose health is affecting their driving ability to hand in their licences to Road Transport Department (JPJ) offices.

Dr Wee also called for all stakeholders to come together and create an effective and inclusive plan for all.

On Friday (Sept 24), Bukit Aman Traffic Investigation and Enforcement Department (JSPT) director Comm Datuk Azisman Alias had proposed that the government limit the issuance of Motor Vehicle Licences to senior citizens.

He said this is because the health condition of senior citizens could contribute to road accidents. He said that senior citizens should also undergo a medical check-up and get approval from a doctor to ascertain that they are fit to drive.

“Elderly people are more likely to suffer from health conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and blurred vision, which can indirectly cause a road accident.

“There was a case where a senior citizen was caught driving on a motorcycle lane.

The review was sparked by a letter composed by former Blue Origin Communications Director Alexandra Abrams and 20 unnamed current and former employees.

The letter issued a stark warning about the company's advertised mission of wanting to enable a better future for mankind by exploiting space. It claims that Bezos' sales pitch for a Utopian future for humanity is based on a corporate present that is toxic to the core.

The FAA — the nation's top air safety regulator — says it ""takes every safety allegation seriously and the agency is reviewing the information.""

A toxic workplace on a dying planet?

Abrams describes several disturbing aspects of the company, mainly centered around the White male dominated inner circle that runs operations. The letter cites sexist behavior and hiring practices, as well as an exploitative labor system in which those close to Bezos stifle dissent and coerce hopelessly overworked or dissatisfied employees into silence through firings and ever more punitive non-disparagement agreements.

Allegations range from systemic sexually inappropriate behavior, to mental and physical duress. The consistent prioritization of ""making progress for Jeff"" over addressing a myriad of safety concerns brought forward by employees is also highlighted. Moreover, the letter alleges that women are mercilessly badgered for raising concerns.

Abrams also claims she was instructed to make it difficult for employees to ask questions at company town hall meetings ostensibly designed as a forum for open discussion. She spoke of a ""dehumanizing"" work atmosphere in which ""troublemakers or agitators"" were singled out and put on lists given to senior managers as part of a broader system of control over workers.

'Be careful with Jeff's money'

Decision making at Blue Origin, the letter claims, is limited to a select inner circle impatient to publicly display progress while ignoring the safety concerns of some engineers. Requests for more staff, she alleges, were regularly rebuffed, with managers and employees told to ""be grateful"" and to ""be careful with Jeff's money.""

Abrams' letter claims that the desire to beat billionaires Elon Musk and Richard Branson into space compromised safety. She continued by comparing the breakneck pace of launches and the safety issues that ensue, to those of NASA's doomed Challenger program, where seven astronauts lost their lives after safety was compromised by a desperation to launch.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The shock On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after takeoff. It was then the most severe accident in NASA's space program. Challenger was the third of what would eventually become five space shuttles. Before it exploded, the shuttle had completed nine flights.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Just before the catastrophe Space Shuttle Challenger takes off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. Spectators are applauding. Only seconds later enthusiasm turns into horror. Numerous family members and colleagues of the astronauts are among the viewers.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The victims These seven astronauts were killed in the accident (from left to right): Aerospace engineer Ellison Onizuka, pilot Mike Smith, elementary school teacher Christa McAuliffe, test pilot and aerospace engineer Dick Scobee, payload specialist Greg Jarvis, physicist Ron McNair and electrical engineer and specialist for telemetry Judith Resnik.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Inspiration for generations McAuliffe was supposed to become the first teacher in space - and an inspiration for many other students and teachers. In subsequent years, many astronauts carried on with the idea of bringing science and technology back from space into the classroom. Here, McAuliffe is talking to Barbara Morgan during astronaut training. Morgan stayed behind as a backup for McAuliffe.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes A defective seal One or more o-ring seals failed after a very cold night with freezing temperatures and then high temperatures during takeoff. Exhaust gas came out at the side of the rocket, rather than through the engine. Here the head of the presidential investigation commission William Rogers is testifying at a Senate committee. His deputy, astronaut Neil Armstrong, is listening.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Grief and consternation Germany grieved for the dead astronauts as well. Only three month before the accident, the two first West German astronauts Reinhard Furrer and Ernst Messerschmid (first and fifth from left) flew with the same space shuttle. They launched the German-built Spacelab D-1, the first big space exploration project of the Federal Republic of Germany.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Starting up again after a long break Two and a half years after the tragedy, NASA resumed shuttle flights. On December 29, 1988, Space Shuttle Discovery took off from Cape Canaveral. Again there were glitches: Parts of a tank's insulation broke off. Nevertheless, Discovery became one of the most successful space shuttles, and the most used one, too - between 1984 and 2011, it took off 39 times.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The second catastrophe 17 years and 87 space shuttle flights after the Challenger tragedy, criticism of the program had nearly died down. Then a second catastrophe happened: Space Shuttle Columbia broke apart during reentry into Earth's atmosphere on February 1, 2003. All seven crew members died. The likely cause was damage a wing had suffered during takeoff, when it was hit by a piece of fuel-tank insulation foam.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Essential for space research Despite the two accidents, NASA's shuttle program can look back on a proud history: 133 flights were concluded successfully. Here, Space Shuttle Atlantis is approaching the International Space Station (ISS). Without the shuttles, it would have been almost impossible to build the ISS. The Russian Soyuz capsule in the foreground is today's standard vehicle for human space travel to the ISS.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes A small shuttle in infinite space In comparison to the ISS, Space Shuttle Endeavour looks almost tiny on this picture. It is one of very few photos ever taken of a docked space shuttle at the station. Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli had the opportunity to take the shot in 2011 from inside a Soyuz space capsule on the way home from the ISS.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Serving science Space shuttle Atlantis is docking on to the ISS for the second to last time in May 2010. Its last flight took place one year later. By then, space shuttles had delivered uncountable telecommunication-, navigation- and research satellites into their orbit, including space telescope Hubble. They retrieved and repaired satellites and even visited the Russian space station Mir.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes Riding piggyback for the last flight Space Shuttle Endeavour flies for the last time - mounted on a special Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet. The plane took the shuttle to its retirement home, the California Science Center in Los Angeles. They took a detour to do a final flyby over the Golden Gate Bridge and several cities along the West Coast. Endeavour had seen its last space flight in May 2011, Atlantis' was in July of the same year.

30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes And the dream goes on The future of human space travel looks somewhat like the past: The newest NASA spaceship will be Orion. Its design recalls the first Apollo spaceships. The European Space Agency (ESA) will deliver important components for Orion. The new spaceship will be bigger than the Soyuz spacecrafts and also travel farther - to the moon or maybe even to Mars one day. Author: Fabian Schmidt



Safety, according to the letter, is an afterthought at Blue Origin, both in regard to production and environment, as well as to vehicle flight systems.

The employees behind the letter pointed out the extremely limited scope of the FAA's mandate to regulate the space industry, arguing that it must be expanded.

The letter, published on storytelling platform lioness.co, a website which helps individuals bring their ordeals to the media, ended with another, much broader question, namely: ""Should we as a society allow ego-driven individuals with endless caches of money and very little accountability to be the ones to shape that future?""","['bezos', 'shuttle', 'safety', 'investigates', 'blue', 'letter', 'took', 'origin', 'ago', 'jeff', 'ethics', 'question', 'space', 'explodes', 'astronauts', 'employees', 'challenger', 'faa']","30 years ago: Space Shuttle Challenger explodes The shock On January 28, 1986, Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after takeoff.

According to people familiar with the development, the bus was en route from Delhi to UP's Bahraich via Lucknow when it collided head-on against the truck, leading to the death of the passengers. The tourist bus reached Baburi village on Kisan Path in the Deva Kotwali area around 5.30am on Thursday when a truck heading towards it from the opposite end “suddenly went berserk” and collided against it head-on. Splinters came off from the heavyweight vehicles, according to eyewitness reports, owing to the fact that both the bus and the truck were travelling at very high speeds.

Police personnel and officials from the district administration rushed to the spot on receiving news of the accident. As per a report by HT's sister publication Live Hindustan, emergency responders managed to cut off portions from the bus and retrieve the injured from the accident spot.

Bell Bottom will stream on Amazon Prime Video from September 16th. The OTT giant has announced the release date officially. But then, going by the buzz on the social media, audience seems to be not very excited about the film and it may not even excite the OTT audience.

Bollywood filmmakers have been shell-shocked with the response for Bell Bottom and that has sealed any hopes of a recovery in near future. As a result, more and more films are looking at a possible Direct-to-OTT release now. Amazon Prime Video is obviously the beneficiary of such a trend.

So, Bell Bottom has helped Amazon Prime Video in that way even if it fails when it arrives on the Platform.

246,Emma Raducanu joins an illustrious list of teen Slam winners,"Last updated on .From the section Tennis

Emma Raducanu made her tour-level debut in June 2021 at WTA Nottingham

British teenager Emma Raducanu rewrote the history books when she won her maiden Grand Slam title at the US Open.

The 18-year-old new British number one, who has risen to 23 in the world rankings, joins an illustrious list of some of the best-known names in tennis, who hit the big time when they won their first major title while still a teenager.

Martina Hingis is the youngest female Slam champion in the Open era

Martina Hingis - 16 years, 117 days (Australian Open, 1997)

The 'Swiss Miss' is still the youngest female Slam champion in the Open era, winning the 1997 Australian Open by beating Mary Pierce. She went on to win five Grand Slam singles titles in total.

Hingis first retired in 2003 after two ankle surgeries. She returned to competition in non-tour events in 2005 before announcing her comeback to the WTA Tour a year later.

In 2007, Hingis was investigated for testing positive for a metabolite of cocaine and was suspended by the International Tennis Federation for two years.

She made a third return to the sport in 2015, focusing more on doubles, winning four Slam titles in women's doubles and six mixed doubles titles before retiring for a final time in 2017.

Monica Seles - 16 years, 189 days (French Open 1990)

Seles won eight Slam titles before she turned 20, but, in 1993, was the victim of an on-court knife attack. She returned to the tour in 1995 and won another major, but struggled to find her best form. She played her last official tour match at the 2003 French Open.

Tracey Austin - 16 years, 270 days (US Open, 1979)

Austin remains the youngest US Open champion in history and added another title in 1981.

The American struggled with injuries after that and was often sidelined for long periods. She attempted a comeback in 1988 but had a near-fatal road accident a year later. She attempted another return in 1993, but finally retired the following year.

Maria Sharapova - 17 years, 75 days (Wimbledon, 2004)

Famously beat Serena Williams in the final at Wimbledon 17 years ago to claim her maiden major trophy. The Russian went on to win a total of five Slam titles, including two French Opens on clay - a surface on which she famously described herself as being a ""cow on ice"".

Sharapova retired in 2020 after being hampered by shoulder injuries in the latter stages of her career. She had served a 15-month suspension from the sport after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.

Michael Chang - 17 years, 110 days (French Open, 1989)

Michael Chang is the youngest male Slam winner, but despite making two more finals, never won another one

The most notable to win only one is the youngest male Slam champion Chang, who beat Stefan Edberg at Roland Garros in 1989.

Despite reaching a world ranking of number two in the world and a total of 34 career titles, the American was unable to get over the line in the Australian Open and US Open finals in 1996.

Arantxa Sanchez Vicario - 17 years, 174 days (French Open, 1989)

Having followed older brothers Emilio and Javier Sanchez into the sport, the Spaniard upset Steffi Graf to make history at Roland Garros.

Two more Paris triumphs followed - including her last Slam in 1998 - and a US Open success in 1994, while she was runner-up twice at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. She also claimed six women's doubles and four mixed doubles titles before retiring in 2002.

Two years later, Sanchez Vicario returned to play in the 2004 Olympics - her fifth appearance in the Games, from which she has two silver and bronze medals.

Boris Becker - 17 years, 228 days (Wimbledon, 1985)

At the time the dynamic German won his first Wimbledon title, he was the youngest male player to win a Slam in the Open era.

Becker was also unseeded when he started his run, although he was 20 in the ATP rankings as seedings only went up to 16 back then.

He went on to win Wimbledon twice more, plus two Australian Open titles and the 1989 US Open.

Mats Wilander - 17 years, 293 days (French Open, 1982)

The Swede made his mark when he won the French Open as an unseeded player, defeating Guillermo Vilas.

Wilander went on to win seven Slam titles in total with his best year in 1988 when he won three of the four, only missing out at Wimbledon.

He never won the singles title at SW19 but did win the men's doubles in SW19 with compatriot Joakim Nystrom in 1986.

A three-time Davis Cup winner with Sweden, he was handed a three-month suspension by the ITF, having tested positive for cocaine at the 1995 French Open, and retired a year later.

Serena Williams - 17 years, 350 days (US Open, 1999)

Still active and still chasing the elusive 24th Grand Slam singles title which would draw her level with record-holder Margaret Court, Williams has seen her attempts in recent years thwarted.

She won the US Open in her first final, beating fellow teenager Hingis.

She first became a world number one in 2002, but has been troubled with injuries recently. Her last Slam title came in 2017, when she won the Australian Open while in the early stages of pregnancy.

Steffi Graf - 17 years, 357 days (French Open, 1987)

Graf's arrival on the scene was in the years of Martina Navratilova's dominance, and the German beat the then world number one for a first French Open success.

She won a 'Golden Slam' of all four majors and Olympic gold in 1988, finishing with 22 major singles titles in her career.

Knee and wrist injuries beset the latter stages of her career and she retired at the age of 30 in 1999, when she was still ranked world number three and had just won the French Open and reached the Wimbledon final.

Bjorn Borg - 18 years, 10 days (French Open, 1974)

Borg's breakthrough as a teenage sensation in the mid-1970s helped make tennis front-page news.

The Swede won 11 Slams - six French Opens and five Wimbledons - and he will be forever remembered for the epic 1980 showpiece against John McEnroe at SW19.

His initial retirement at the age of 26 in 1983 was a shock to the tennis world. He attempted a comeback between 1991-1993, but failed to win a match on the ATP Tour.

Rafael Nadal - 19 years, 3 days (French Open, 2005)

Nadal is the only member of the 'Big Three' of himself, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic to win his first Slam title as a teenager.

He has won an unprecedented 13 at the French Open, together with seven at other majors. Nadal, Federer and Djokovic are all currently tied on 20 Slam titles each.

The 35-year-old has struggled with injury throughout his career and ended his 2021 season last month because of a recurring left-foot problem.

Other teenagers who also won Slams

Pete Sampras, aged 19 years and 29 days, landed the 1990 US Open with victory over Andre Agassi. It was the first of the American's 14 career majors, which included seven at Wimbledon. It was a record total in men's tennis until surpassed by Roger Federer in 2009.

Aged 19 years and 324 days, success in the 1985 Australian Open final against fellow Swede Mats Wilander was the first of Stefan Edberg's six career Slams.

On the women's side, Hana Mandlikova became the second-youngest female player to win a Grand Slam at the time when she beat Australian Wendy Turnbull in the 1980 Australian Open final. The Prague-born player, who was then aged 18 years and 329 days, would win three more Slams in her career before retiring a decade later.

Russia's Svetlana Kuznetsova won two Slams in her career, the first in the US Open, aged 19 years and 76 days, when she beat compatriot Elena Dementieva. She also landed the 2009 French Open.

Bianca Andreescu stunned Serena Williams at the US Open in 2019, aged 19 years and 83 days, but has been plagued with injuries ever since.

Iga Swiatek won the 2020 French Open aged 19 years and 132 days, beating Sofia Kenin, but the Polish player has yet to follow that up.

American Chris Evert claimed the first of her 18 singles Grand Slams when she beat Olga Morozova in the 1974 French Open final at the age of 19 years and 176 days.

Iva Majoli upset Martina Hingis to win her only Slam title in the 1997 French Open aged 19 years and 299 days, ending Hingis' 37-match winning streak and handing the Swiss her first defeat in a Grand Slam final.

247,Let's talk about sex — in space,"German astronaut Matthias Maurer breezes through interviews, rarely missing a beat when he answers journalists' questions around his upcoming six-month trip to the International Space Station (ISS). But one topic throws even Maurer off momentarily: sex drive in space.

""We haven't talked about this, because it's a professional environment,"" he replied to DW's question on whether astronauts exchange insights on how to handle their desires.

Thanks to commercial spaceflights, more people are entering the cosmos than ever before. Just this past week,SpaceX launched four tourists through the Earth's orbit. Ten years from now, the first crew of astronauts will likely set off on a mission to Mars that could last multiple years.

Sexuality is intrinsic to human nature and inevitably factors into space missions. But while space science is progressing, our understanding of sex in space is still basic.

NASA, the US' National Aeronautics and Space Administration, insists that no humans have had sex in space, and American astronauts famously avoid the topic. The few experiments that have been conducted on space sex focused on animals, not humans.

""We need to know more about sexuality in space if we are serious about long-duration space flights. Sexuality is very possibly going to be a part of that,"" Paul Root Wolpe, who spent 15 years as a senior bioethicist at NASA, told DW.

German astronaut Matthias Maurer told DW that there is no official training on sexuality in space

Sex in space matters

Addressing sexuality in space isn't just important because it's what's on everyone's mind. Asked by DW whether sexuality is part of an astronaut's training, Matthias Maurer replied: ""No, but maybe it should be.""

""If we look at sexual health as a core component of health, it's important to understand the conditions we are putting individuals in,"" Saralyn Mark, former senior medical adviser to NASA, told DW.

Sex and masturbation are linked to physical and mental health — that doesn't change in space.

Ejaculation is essential for men to avoid the risk of bacteria building up in their prostate, and orgasms have been shown to relieve stress and anxiety as well as improve sleep quality, which likely helps during a high-pressure space mission.

Has it already happened?

We can only speculate, but it seems likely that sex in space has already happened. There are two space missions that jump out as candidates for the first cosmic coitus.

In 1982, Russian cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, the second-ever woman in space, joined the Soyuz T-7 space mission for eight days. Two male colleagues were already on board when she arrived, making it the first coed space mission.

In his book, Höllenritt durch Raum und Zeit (A hell ride through time and space), German astronaut Ulrich Walter notes that, according to the team's doctor, Oleg Georgievich Gazenko, the flight was planned with a sexual encounter in mind.

The second mission in question took place in 1992, when NASA's Space Shuttle Endeavor was launched with a married couple on board. Mark Lee and Jan Davis, both astronauts, met at NASA. They married in secret a year before liftoff. Their joint flight to space was practically their honeymoon.

Svetlana Savitskaya (right), Anatoly Berezovoy (left) and Valentin Lebedev made up the world's first mixed-sex space crew

How is it different from here on Earth?

So, we can assume that sex in space is a reality. But how is it different to ours on Earth? Let's start with the basics: sex drive.

The little publicly available information that we have indicates that being in space leads to reduced libido, at least at first.

That's because microgravity, the weightlessness astronauts experience in space, causes hormonal changes, like decreases in estrogen. Low estrogen levels have been linked to a drop in sex drive.

Unfortunately, most of what we know about hormones in space comes only from tests on men. That's because only 11.5% of astronauts are female, and the relatively few women who have been to space opted to go on birth control beforehand to avoid menstruation. This makes it tricky to disentangle artificial hormonal changes from those caused by space flight.

Another factor in cosmic sex drive is a change in astronauts' internal clock.

""When you're going around the planet right now, every 90 minutes, your circadian rhythms are altered and that alters everything, including your sex hormones and probably your libido,"" said Saralyn Mark.

The science also matches astronaut Walter's on-site experience. In his book, he writes that, during his short 10-day stay in space, he had no libido.

But there's hope: According to Walter, astronauts' sex drive does readjust after a few weeks in space.

Astronauts and arousal

While our knowledge of sex drive is still fuzzy, we have a much clearer picture on whether humans can get physically aroused in space.

Microgravity causes blood flow to reverse its course and move upwards, towards the head and chest, instead of circulating in the lower half of the body. The internet abounds with speculation on whether this prevents men from getting erections in space.

When asked whether space boners are viable, Mark gave a clear answer: ""Yes, microgravity does not affect that path.""

Root Wolpe agreed: ""There is no reason why it should be biologically impossible.""

Ron Garan, an American astronaut who went to space twice, was asked whether erections are possible in space on an Ask Me Anything Reddit thread.

""I know of nothing that happens to the human body on Earth that can't happen in space,"" he answered.

For women, arousal in space is possible as well but getting wet feels physically different than on planet Earth. In zero gravity, liquids collect at their point of origin, meaning they form a blob at the spot where they are secreted, instead of flowing freely.

Astronauts Mark Lee and Jan Davis spent their honeymoon aboard a space shuttle

Velcro and dolphin sex

So much for the biological basics. Now we are left with speculating about the act itself. One thing is certain: Sex in space is a far more exhausting endeavor than here on Earth.

In zero gravity, Newton's third law, which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, makes thrusting against each other a real challenge.

""We don't realize how much gravity assists us in the act of intercourse,"" said Wolpe. ""Sex involves pressure. In space, without any counterforce, you end up constantly pushing your partner away from you.""

But where there's a will, there's a way.

In an interview with German public broadcaster NDR, Walter suggested that astronauts could adopt a method employed by dolphins in the ocean, where a third party holds the other two together to prevent them from drifting.

Wolpe has another idea: ""Everything on the walls of the space station is covered in Velcro, so you could take advantage of that by velcroing one partner to the wall. You have to get creative in this space.""","['sex', 'drive', 'lets', 'sexuality', 'talk', 'mark', 'wolpe', 'walter', 'space', 'astronauts', 'astronaut', 'maurer']","But one topic throws even Maurer off momentarily: sex drive in space.

248,Eastern Cape woman found guilty of stealing R330 000 in Road Accident Fund money from stepchildren,"An Eastern Cape woman has been found guilty of stealing R331 000 from her stepchildren.

The money was part of a Road Accident Fund claim made on behalf of the children.

The woman was not the children's caregiver, as stated in the claim.

An Eastern Cape woman has been found guilty of stealing more than R330 000 in a Road Accident Fund (RAF) claim intended to benefit her stepchildren. She has been handed a six-year suspended sentence and ordered to repay the stolen funds.

READ | Durban lawyer arrested for allegedly defrauding RAF clients

Nyameka Mkhatshwa, 49, was convicted and sentenced in the East London Regional Court on charges of theft on Tuesday. The theft relates to a 2014 claim made by Mkhatshwa on behalf of the children, said Hawks spokesperson Captain Yolisa Mgolodela.

""On 14 July 2014, Mkhatshwa lodged a claim with the RAF on behalf of her stepchildren after the death of her husband in a motor vehicle accident. The claim was settled by the RAF and an amount of more than R331 000 was paid into her account,"" said Mgolodela.

However, the court heard that Mkhatshwa did not give the money to the stepchildren.

""In her affidavit in support of the claim, she said that she was staying with the children and was supporting them, whereas she never lived with nor supported them,"" said Mgolodela.

A complaint was lodged with the Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation team in East London for investigation, which led to Mkhatshwa's arrest on 16 March 2021.

At the time, she was released on a warning by the East London Magistrate's Court.

""After several court appearances, she received a six-year suspended sentence. She was further ordered to repay the victims an amount of R100 000 on or before 1 October 2021 and the balance in monthly instalments over a period of 60 months,"" said Mgolodela.

249,Prophet Mohammed cartoonist killed in car crash,"Prophet Mohammed cartoonist killed in car crash

Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks was living under police protection.

STOCKHOLM: Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, who lived under police protection after his 2007 depiction of the Prophet Mohammed prompted death threats, was killed on Sunday in a road accident.

The 75-year-old and two police officers were killed in a collision with an oncoming truck, Swedish police confirmed to AFP.

""This is being investigated like any other road accident. Because two policemen were involved, an investigation has been assigned to a special section of the prosecutor's office,"" a police spokesperson told AFP, adding that there was no suspicion of foul play.

The accident occurred near the small town Markaryd when the car Vilks was travelling in crashed into an oncoming truck. Both vehicles caught fire and the truck driver was hospitalised, according to police.

In a statement, the police said the cause of the accident was unclear.

""The person we were protecting and two colleagues died in this inconceivable and terribly sad tragedy,"" said regional police head Carina Persson.

Vilks had been under police protection since his 2007 cartoon of Mohammed with a dog's body prompted outrage among those who consider depictions of the Muslim prophet deeply offensive or blasphemous.

Al-Qaeda offered a $100,000 reward for Vilks' murder.

The depiction also sparked diplomatic friction, with Sweden's then prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt meeting ambassadors from several Muslim countries to ease tensions.

In 2015, Vilks survived a gun attack at a free-speech conference in Copenhagen that left a Danish film director dead.","['protection', 'car', 'road', 'cartoonist', 'vilks', 'killed', 'truck', 'crash', 'prophet', 'mohammed', 'swedish', 'accident']","Prophet Mohammed cartoonist killed in car crashSwedish cartoonist Lars Vilks was living under police protection.

252,Bride and groom respond to road accident hours before wedding,"On Monday afternoon September 20th, a Muslim bride, Nour Abu Asi, and her groom, Mohamed Byadsi, were driving back from taking pre-wedding photos outside of their hometown of Jatt, an Arab-Israeli town located in the triangle region of Israel when they spotted a motor vehicle accident involving a young boy on his bicycle and a truck. Even though they were dressed in their wedding attire, the couple, both of whom are United Hatzalah volunteer first responders, didn’t hesitate to stop by the accident and provide emergency medical treatment to the injured nine-year-old boy.

“The boy was riding his bicycle when he suddenly swerved and hit the truck causing himself to sustain some serious lacerations and contusions,” said Mohamed. “I didn’t think twice, as I pulled the car over. Nour and I both got out in our wedding attire and rushed over to assist the young boy while we called United Hatzalah’s Dispatch and Command Center and requested additional volunteers and an ambulance. Our wedding activities would be put on hold for a while as this boy needed our help,” he added.

Nour, who in addition to being a first responder for United Hatzalah is also a nurse in Tel HaShomer Hospital, bandaged the boy’s hands while her husband-to-be, Mohamed, checked the boy’s vital signs and took an oral history of his young patient. “The boy was crying and we tried to comfort him while we bandaged up his wounds. He was scared and so we asked the dispatcher to try to get in touch with his parents while we treated him,” said Nour.

When the boy’s parents arrived at the scene, they declined an ambulance transport and instead took the boy to a nearby hospital on their own. They thanked the almost-newlyweds for their help in treating their son after the accident.

When the boy was treated and his parents had taken him to the hospital for further care, Nour and Mohamed got back into their car and headed back to the wedding hall for the ceremony. “Wherever I go and whatever I am doing, I feel a sense of responsibility to help others because I have the training and ability to do so,” added Mohamed. “Wearing my wedding suit, in the middle of my wedding day, that is when God decides to test me and see if I will still live up to my responsibility of helping others. Of course I decided to stop the car and help. What else can a volunteer EMT do on his own wedding day? What better way to celebrate than by helping others? Nour and I didn’t even think twice, we jumped at the opportunity to help. I am thankful that we passed this first test of our marriage together and we helped another person while doing so.”","['respond', 'hours', 'wedding', 'groom', 'road', 'boy', 'mohamed', 'hospital', 'bride', 'didnt', 'parents', 'nour', 'united', 'young', 'help', 'accident']","“The boy was riding his bicycle when he suddenly swerved and hit the truck causing himself to sustain some serious lacerations and contusions,” said Mohamed.

253,Kenyan policeman wakes up from coma to find he was sacked,"A Kenyan police officer has woken up from a nine-month coma to find he had been sacked for desertion.

Neither the family nor the police force had any idea where Constable Reuben Kimutai Lel was - his niece told the BBC they thought he was dead.

But it turns out that he had been the victim of a road accident and had been in one of the country's biggest hospitals all along.

He only regained consciousness last week.

His niece Joan Jeptoo told the BBC of the family's horror as they searched for his body in morgues after they had given up on his chances of being alive.

At one point they almost collected a decomposing body from a morgue that was said to be him.

""We thought he was dead because his phone was off. Early this year we went to collect a body that we were told resembled him, but the fingerprints didn't match,"" she said.

The police officer was admitted on 21 December 2020 as an unknown person at the main referral hospital in the capital, Nairobi. He had no identity documents with him.

Meanwhile, he was sacked from his job, charged in absentia with desertion and a warrant was issued for his arrest. The case was later withdrawn after police failed to find him.

He regained consciousness last week, and although he has still not regained his full memory, he was able to identify himself by name and that he was a police officer - and so the search for his relatives began.

His niece was contacted by police last Wednesday and was told to go and identify him at hospital.

""I found him at Kenyatta National Hospital. He could not recognise me and he could not recognise names of members of his family,"" she said.

The police officer was discharged from hospital last Friday and is recuperating at his home in Koibatek, Baringo county, under the care of his wife and family.

According to the Daily Nation news site, arrangements are being made to reinstate him to the police force.

However, his niece said the constable, in his late 50s, was looking forward to his retirement.","['coma', 'kenyan', 'officer', 'policeman', 'sacked', 'body', 'told', 'hospital', 'recognise', 'wakes', 'saidthe', 'thought', 'niece', 'regained']","A Kenyan police officer has woken up from a nine-month coma to find he had been sacked for desertion.

254,Disabled boy who is also full time carer for unwell dad is denied PIP support twice,"PIP is meant to help people with long-term physical or mental health conditions or disabilities. The support can be up to £152.15 a week - but many severely ill people say they have been denied support

Exclusive: Disabled boy who is also full time carer for unwell dad is denied PIP support twice

A father and son who have arthritis and learning difficulties between them say they are struggling to get by after being rejected twice for Personal Independence Payments (PIP).

Their case shows how easy it is for people to fall down the cracks in the PIP system and not get the benefit they need.

PIP is meant to help people with long-term physical or mental health conditions or disabilities. The support can be up to £152.15 a week.

But many report finding it hard to get PIP payments and are rejected by assessors working for DWP.

Two people grappling with PIP unsuccessfully are David Rhind, 52, and his son Christoper Rhind, 22.

The Rhinds, who live in Aberdeenshire, say the lack of PIP is making a huge difference to their lives.

Image: David Rhind) David Rhind)

David has bad arthritis and needs full-time care.

Christopher has learning difficulties and went to a special needs school. He is on medication for sleep deprivation, depression and breathlessness, has anxiety and has thoughts of self-harming, his father said, and has bitten his fingernails off.

David's wife was his carer, before she sadly passed away in November last year after not fully recovering from a road accident.

Now Christopher has stepped in to care for his father, helping him wash and dress, as well as cleaning the house and cooking.

But the reality is that the father and son care for each other.

David said: ""My son is now my carer and I help him as much as I can. He helps me wash, dress and he cleans the house with a little help from me as I can't do much and he helps me down in the village as he can't make a journey alone.

""I write things down for him so he remembers and I help him cook. He does all the lifting, and I tell him the temperature and time things need for cooking.

""My wife showed him how to use the washing machine and when he goes out I have to be with him or he would get lost.""

Christopher had an assessment for PIP in as soon as he left school.

Technically he is eligible for PIP because anxiety, cognitive disorders and learning disorders are qualifying factors for the benefit.

But he never got the benefit, as he was so overcome with worry on the journey to his first PIP assessment that he became ill and had to return home.

He was assessed again on July 17 this year, but was rejected again.

Most recently the PIP assessor said if he can care for his father, he can plan a journey or cook a meal unaided - both signs someone can cope and doesn't need PIP.

David said: ""He's on meds for his nerves and meds for sleep deprivation, and a salbutamol inhaler which he uses now and again. But yet PIP say if you suffer any mental health issue you are entitled to [the benefit], which is all lies - they're uncaring and unhuman.""

The second rejection knocked Christopher's health, his father said.

""As he told me, no one cares,"" David said. ""But he said I'm his rock, and I said he is mine.

""PIP to my son would help him a great deal, as with his medical health it would help him a lot. He has never had any savings as he can't work, and is now my full-time carer.""

DWP has been approached for comment.

Thousands of PIP assessments overturned in court

Around 293,000 people across the UK have overturned a government decision to deny them Personal Independence Payments (PIP) in the past three years.

It stems from a High Court ruling in December 2017 that found the DWP had not correctly followed regulations for the points given for being able to go on journeys.

Claimants should have been awarded the standard mobility rate of PIP if their psychological distress meant they were unable to undertake any unfamiliar journey without having someone with them.

And they should have been given the enhanced rate if they could not go on any familiar journey without support.

»Denne sejr er dedikeret til ham,« skrev klubben.

En af Nices mere velkendte ansigter, Dante, der også har spillet i Bayern München, var også påvirket efter opgøret:

»Vi står med blandede følelser. Vi hørte, at vi mistede et tidligere talent fra vores talentakademi. På trods af sejren var der intet eufori. Vi kondolerer og sender tanker til familien,« siger Dante ifølge det franske medie RMC.

Rémi Mestrallet fik sin fodboldopdragelse på Nices fodboldakademi, men han nåede dog aldrig at spille en officiel seniorkamp for førsteholdet.

Franskmandens nok største fodboldmæssige højdepunkter var, da han spillede i to træningskampe imod henholdsvis Rangers og Celtic. I juli 2021 skiftede han til den franske klub Fréjus-Saint-Raphaël FC.

256,Overspeeding leading cause of road crashes – FRSC,"By Steve Oko

The Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, has identified overspeeding as the leading cause of road crashes in Nigeria.

The Abia State Sector Commander of FRSC, Mr. Paul Ugwu who disclosed this in an exclusive chat with Vanguard, cautioned motorists against overspeeding and other traffic offenses.

He said the corp would tomorrow (Tuesday) flag off ’ember months’ safety campaign as part of measures to minimise road traffic offenses in the state ahead of the Yuletide.

The FRSC boss said that the corps would also conduct free vision, high blood pressure and other vital tests for commercial vehicle drivers in Abia during the campaign.

He gave the theme of this year’s campaign as: “Maintain Speed, Avoid Night Travels and Enjoy Quality Road Experience”.

Ugwu said that the target of the campaign was to reduce road crashes by 15% and fatality by 20%.

He disclosed that ambulances would be deployed and positioned along critical corridors of the state during the “ember months to ensure road accident victims are attended to within five minutes”.

The FRSC boss advised motorists especially passenger- vehicles against night travels saying that statistics has shown that most road crashes occur at night.

He also advised motorists to ensure they posses valid driver’s license and vehicle documents, warming that road traffic offenders especially those guilty of lane indiscipline, overloading, drunk-driving, using mobile phone while on the wheel risk prosecution at the mobile court during the season.

The FRSC boss who also threatened to impound mechanically deficient vehicles, advised motorists to ensure they have sound spare tyre to avoid getting stranded on the way.

“Your spare tyre should be your best tyre not any how tyre”, he advised.

He said that contrary to perceptions in some quarters, the corps is not all about catching road traffic offenders but sometimes conduct free safety checks and offer advice without booking offenders.

260,Funeral details announced for Gorey man (22) who died following collision,"Finlay (right) with his classmates having won the Amber flag for mental health.

The funeral of a young Gorey man who died following a road accident last weekend will take place at noon this Friday in Christ Church Gorey.

Finlay Power (22) will be reposing at Murphy's Funeral Home, The Avenue, Gorey, tomorrow (Thursday, September 16) from 3 p.m. until 8 p.m. The removal will take place on Friday at 11.30 a.m. to Christ Church, Gorey for funeral followed by private cremation.

Finlay from Annagh, Hollyfort, was the son of James and Catherine Power, brother to James and Erin and partner of Nicole.

He had been a member of Gorey Civil Defence for the past two years and had attended a training session with the group the evening before the accident, which took place on the N2 at Edmonstown, County Louth, on Saturday last.

Speaking before news of Finlay’s death emerged, his Gorey Civil Defence colleague Celestine Swords described him as “the sort of lad who was always eager, and he’d help us in any way that he could as a volunteer. He is very popular in all circles and everyone would describe him as a gentleman.”

On Monday, his former principal Linda Dunne said that, during his time at Coláiste Bhride, Carnew, Finlay was a reliable, hard-working young man who “always got things done and was willing to help out”. She said Finlay was pivotal in the school achieving an amber award for mental health and everyone could see the leadership potential he held.

""Finlay would have been instrumental in that and was very generous with his time and you don’t get very many young people who are like that with volunteerism,” she said.

Tributes have been pouring in online and neighbour to the Power family, Cllr Anthony Donohoe, sent his sympathies to the family.

""My deepest sympathies go out to the Power family on the loss of their son Finlay following this tragic incident. There is a deep sense of sadness in the Annagh and Hollyfort areas as a dark cloud hangs over the area.

""By all accounts, Finlay was an up and coming young man and he will be sadly missed,” said Cllr Donohoe.

Gardaí are continuing to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the collision to come forward.

Any road users who were travelling on the N2 in the townland of Edmonstown, Louth, on Saturday evening (September 11) between 8 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. and who may have camera footage (including dash cam) are asked to make it available to Gardaí.

261,Kinahan associate Raffaele Imperiale involved in horror Ferrari crash that killed one man,"Daniel Kinahan’s Italian mafia associate Raffaele Imperiale was the “protagonist” of a serious road accident while driving a Ferrari in which one man died, Italian investigators have claimed.

The claim was made in new documents filed by Italian prosecutors as part of their case against drug trafficker Imperiale.

The 46-year-old boss of the Naples-based Camorra organisation is currently facing extradition to Italy from Dubai where he was arrested in August.

According to prosecutors, one of Imperiale's associates, who was behind the wheel of a Lamborghini, was also involved in the fatal crash in Spain.

But according to one informer who is co-operating with Italian authorities, Imperiale abandoned his car Ferrari following the crash - despite the fact it was worth a six-figure sum.

""He did not show disappointment that the prestigious cars had been destroyed, as he had a lot of money,” the informer has claimed.

The details are included in statements given to Italy’s Direzione Investigativa Antimafia ('Anti-Mafia Investigation Directorate'), also known as DIA, from numerous “collaborators of justice”.

These include Carmine Cerrato, the former right-hand man of Imperiale’s fellow mafia boss Lelluccio Amato.

Imperiale had been wanted by Italian authorities since 2016 to serve an eight year sentence for drug trafficking before his arrest in Dubai.

The Mafia Don was secretly arrested in his luxury Dubai villa while he was in the pool with his wife and four children.

Imperiale is a known associate of Daniel Kinahan and was a guest at his 2017 wedding in Dubai.

The Naples review court has now ordered that Imperiale must remain in prison in Dubai after rejecting a request by his lawyers that he freed pending his extradition.

The court made the decision after hearing Imperiale is not a ""simple drug supplier"" but ""one of the pillars on which the whole Camorra organization of the Di Lauro clan splinters rests"".

Prosecutors also claim Imperiale has ties with the leaders of Holland's notorious 'Mocro Maffia', lead by Ridouan Taghi.

Imperiale is believed to be one of the leaders of a 'super-cartel' which controls a major portion of Europe's lucrative cocaine trade.

Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) documents sent to Dutch police identified Imperiale, Dutch mobster Ridouan Taghi, Bosnian criminal Edin Gačanin, Richard 'El Rico' Vega and Daniel Kinahan as the heads of a so-called ‘super drug cartel.’

According to the DEA, Imperiale, Taghi and Edin Gačanin also attended Kinahan’s wedding at the plush Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai in 2017.

The DEA documents described the ‘super drugs cartel’ as one of the world’s fifty largest drug cartels, with a virtual monopoly of the Peruvian cocaine trade.

The documents said the ‘super drugs cartel’ controlled around a third of the cocaine trade into Europe – with the main point of access through Dutch ports.

Born in Italy, Imperiale’s criminal career began in earnest in 1996 when an older brother who died bequeathed him the Rockland coffee shop in Amsterdam.

From here Imperiale is alleged to have embarked on his criminal career by selling ‘soft’ drugs before expanding into cocaine trafficking with Dutch drug trader Rick van de Bunt.

Imperiale was later introduced by Antonio Orefice, a member of the Moccia clan, to Elio Amato, brother of Raffaele Amato, who was at that time one of the top drug traffickers of the Di Lauro clan.

During those years Imperiale earned millions of euros, becoming the point of contact for the Di Lauro’s organization in dealing with drug trafficking cartels in Peru, Ecuador and Colombia.

Imperiale is also known to be a fanatical collector of art works.

In 2016, two Van Gogh paintings, stolen from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam in 2002, were recovered in a villa in Castellammare di Stabia, owned by him.

According to authorities, Imperiale was spending a fortune maintaining a lavish lifestyle in Dubai.

In March of this year further evidence emerged of the links between the Kinahan cartel and Imperiale at the trial of Richard ‘El Rico’ Riquelme in Amsterdam.

Judges heard briefly from the prosecution how Kinahan, was a “regular contact” of Riquelme’s and was in a video on a phone seized from him following his arrest and extradition to Holland from Chile in 2017.

In June, Riquelme was sentenced to 11 years in prison after being found guilty of operating an assassination ring and laundering drug money.

His trial heard he had exchanged phone messages organising gangland murders with jailed drug boss Taghi.","['di', 'man', 'italian', 'associate', 'cocaine', 'drug', 'raffaele', 'involved', 'ferrari', 'imperiale', 'killed', 'dutch', 'dubai', 'documents', 'crash', 'kinahan', 'horror', 'van']","Daniel Kinahan’s Italian mafia associate Raffaele Imperiale was the “protagonist” of a serious road accident while driving a Ferrari in which one man died, Italian investigators have claimed.

262,"Three killed, two injured in Bauchi road accident","The Federal Road Safety Corps in Bauchi State has confirmed that three people were killed in a fatal crash that occurred on Tuesday at Dungulbi village, close to the Muslim burial ground site.

Our correspondent learnt that two people also sustained varying degrees of injury in the crash.

The state Sector Commander, FRSC, Yusuf Abdullahi, disclosed this in a telephone interview with our correspondent on Wednesday.

He said the crash involved a Station Wagon Opel Vectra, with number plate DSA-120 AA, and a commercial Toyota Hiace, Gombe Mass Transit, with number plate GME-74 YX.

Abdullahi said, “The incident, involving six male adults, happened opposite the Muslim Burial Ground junction yesterday (Tuesday) around 8.32pm. Immediately we got the information, we rushed to the scene within 26 minutes.

“The crash was caused by a tyre burst and this was confirmed to our men by the passengers who survived.

“The tyre burst led to the crash because when it happened, the driver lost control and then had a head-on collision with the car in the opposite direction.

“The victims were rushed to the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital, Bauchi, for treatment and confirmation. At the hospital, three of them were confirmed dead. Two others sustained varying degrees of injury.

“The driver of the bus, who was trapped, died as a result of the fire, while two passengers in the other vehicle died.”

He explained that the station wagon vehicle was not engulfed by fire, while the Toyota Hiace bus caught fire after the crash happened.

Abdullahi advised drivers against speeding, night travels, and other practices that put their lives and those of other road users at risk.

263,ECOWAS seeks efficient road transportation,"The Economic Community of West African States has advocated an effective and efficient road transport system in the region.

The Commissioner in charge of Infrastructure at the ECOWAS Commission, Mr Pathe Gueye, at the validation workshop for the draft road safety policy for the ECOWAS region held in Lagos, said there was the need for harmonisation of the highway design codes in the ECOWAS region.

He said, “Road Safety is an important element for the security in West Africa and the World. In 2016, the World Health Organisation in its report informed us that there were more than 6,000 cases of road accident deaths. If we bring that to a population of 1,000 inhabitants, we are about an average of three to five death ratio. This ratio is higher compared to the ratio given by the WHO and it is five times higher than what is obtainable in Europe.

“This shows that the necessity for West Africa to take the responsibility of road safety issue seriously is very important. We have also observed that those who are involved in those road accidents are aged between 16 and 25, which constitute the youths of our sub-region.

“Therefore, the ECOWAS Commission cannot fold its arms and continue to watch our youths die. There is the need to harmonise a framework so that the solution can be sought to improve on this situation.”

The Deputy Corps Marshall, Operations, Federal Road Safety Commission, Mr Kayode Fanola, said Nigeria would benefit from the ECOWAS draft policy on road safety.

“We have made inputs into the draft policy where we articulated what Nigeria has done, the legislation we have and the Nigerian Road Safety Strategy was also highlighted,” he said.

266,Funeral details announced for Gorey man (22) who died following collision,"Finlay (right) with his classmates having won the Amber flag for mental health.

The funeral of a young Gorey man who died following a road accident last weekend will take place at noon this Friday in Christ Church Gorey.

Finlay Power (22) will be reposing at Murphy's Funeral Home, The Avenue, Gorey, tomorrow (Thursday, September 16) from 3 p.m. until 8 p.m. The removal will take place on Friday at 11.30 a.m. to Christ Church, Gorey for funeral followed by private cremation.

Finlay from Annagh, Hollyfort, was the son of James and Catherine Power, brother to James and Erin and partner of Nicole.

He had been a member of Gorey Civil Defence for the past two years and had attended a training session with the group the evening before the accident, which took place on the N2 at Edmonstown, County Louth, on Saturday last.

Speaking before news of Finlay’s death emerged, his Gorey Civil Defence colleague Celestine Swords described him as “the sort of lad who was always eager, and he’d help us in any way that he could as a volunteer. He is very popular in all circles and everyone would describe him as a gentleman.”

On Monday, his former principal Linda Dunne said that, during his time at Coláiste Bhride, Carnew, Finlay was a reliable, hard-working young man who “always got things done and was willing to help out”. She said Finlay was pivotal in the school achieving an amber award for mental health and everyone could see the leadership potential he held.

""Finlay would have been instrumental in that and was very generous with his time and you don’t get very many young people who are like that with volunteerism,” she said.

Tributes have been pouring in online and neighbour to the Power family, Cllr Anthony Donohoe, sent his sympathies to the family.

""My deepest sympathies go out to the Power family on the loss of their son Finlay following this tragic incident. There is a deep sense of sadness in the Annagh and Hollyfort areas as a dark cloud hangs over the area.

""By all accounts, Finlay was an up and coming young man and he will be sadly missed,” said Cllr Donohoe.

Gardaí are continuing to appeal to anyone who may have witnessed the collision to come forward.

Any road users who were travelling on the N2 in the townland of Edmonstown, Louth, on Saturday evening (September 11) between 8 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. and who may have camera footage (including dash cam) are asked to make it available to Gardaí.

267,"Pedestrian injured in crash that killed Joburg mayor dies, bodyguards recovering in hospital","A pedestrian injured in a road crash that killed City of Johannesburg Mayor Jolidee Matongo has died.

Matongo's two bodyguards are recovering in hospital.

Police are investigating charges of culpable homicide and reckless and negligent driving.



A pedestrian injured in the road accident that claimed the life of City of Johannesburg Mayor Jolidee Matongo has died.

According to the ANC in Johannesburg, the pedestrian died on Sunday, increasing the death toll from Saturday night's crash to three.

Matongo and the driver of the bakkie his car collided with died on Saturday. According to the authorities, a pedestrian ran into the road. When Matongo's vehicle tried to avoid him, it collided with the bakkie.

The mayor's two bodyguards were injured. They were in a stable condition in hospital.

Gauteng Premier David Makhura visited the two bodyguards in hospital on Sunday, said mayoral spokesperson Phindile Chauke.

""The premier went to see them in hospital this morning (Sunday). They have been stabilised,"" Chauke said.

Johannesburg Metro Police Department spokesperson Xolani Fihla said a case of culpable homicide and reckless and negligent driving was opened at the Lenasia South police station and the investigation into the accident was continuing.

Matongo, 46, died in the accident after attending a voter registration campaign earlier on Saturday. Matongo and Makhura spent the day in Soweto on a voter registration campaign, led by President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Tributes poured in for Matongo, who was hailed as a committed and selfless activist for the people of Johannesburg.

Makhura said the mayor's death left him shattered.

Makhura's spokesperson, Vuyo Mhaga, said:

He served as a councillor for many years before being elected as the mayor of Johannesburg. Premier Makhura described mayor Matongo as someone who executed his duties with a cool and calm demeanour and remained committed in serving the citizens of Johannesburg. Matongo's death has left Makhura shocked and shattered. He conveyed his condolences to Mrs Matongo and children, his extended family and comrades.

Matongo was elected mayor last month following the death of his predecessor Geoff Makhubo. Makhubo died from Covid-19 complications in July.

Paying tribute to the mayor, Ramaphosa said Matongo was looking forward to the local government elections on 1 November.

""Nothing could prepare any of us for this sudden loss, which has deprived our nation's economic centre of its second executive mayor in two months.

""Matongo has been taken from us at a time when he was totally immersed in improving conditions and creating opportunities for all the people of Johannesburg and stakeholders in the metropolitan economy. Like all of us, he was looking forward to the forthcoming election, and we saw in person today (Saturday) that he had put his heart and soul into mobilising the people of the city to make their voices heard on 1 November,"" Ramaphosa said in a statement on Saturday night.

Former mayor of Johannesburg and leader of ActionSA Herman Mashaba said Matongo had been taken away too soon.

269,Mystery of 'stolen' North West aircraft parts solved,"The plane parts that were impounded in Mahikeng earlier this week have been released to their owner.

Police and the provincial government say the parts were being repaired at the local airport.

The parts were transported in three trucks.

North West police say they have solved the mystery of three trucks found transporting aircraft parts earlier this week.



After days of investigation, the police and provincial government have determined that the parts were at the GD Montshioa Airport in Mmabatho for repairs, and had not been stolen as many had suspected.

On Tuesday, police in the Mahikeng impounded three trucks when residents raised the alarm after they saw them transporting the parts. Suspicion was that the parts had been stolen.

The trucks had already left Mahikeng when they were intercepted and forced to turn back by the police.

Provincial police spokesperson Colonel Adele Myburgh revealed that, since impounding the trucks, they had discovered who the owner was.

""At first, it seemed suspicious because of how they were driving. That's why we impounded them. But we have managed to determine ownership and, because it is not stolen property, we had to release it.""

'Nothing sinister'

Myburgh said investigations had determined that the parts had been brought to Mahikeng for repairs.

""They (the trucks) were transporting the parts back to their owner after repairs. There was nothing sinister about it, but we just had to be sure.""

The North West government corroborated the police's version of events, and said the parts were being transported from Mahikeng to Emalahleni in Mpumalanga.

The provincial community safety and transport management department said the aircraft parts were scrap metal from planes. It added that they belonged to Anton Grungleigh.

""Mr Grungleigh has for many years been operating the Aircraft Maintenance Organisation at the airport. The company owning the aircraft ostensibly being stolen has decided to relocate to Upington from Mafikeng, and thus transported his properties in trucks from the airport,"" said MEC Sello Lehari.

270,Hushed up: Mzwandile Masina's high speed crash in 'borrowed' blue light car,"A high-speed, midnight road accident involving City of Ekurhuleni mayor Mzwandile Masina has been quietly hushed up.

Masina was at the wheel of a ""blue light"" VIP vehicle he allegedly had no permission to drive. Metro police were told he behaved as if drunk.

Thirteen months later, investigations have stalled and witnesses warned not to talk to the media about the incident.

Shortly after midnight on 20 August last year, a large goods truck driving down the N12 West highway near Alberton was struck from behind by a black BMW 540i, said to have been driven at high speed.

It was not a serious accident: no one was hurt, the truck was undamaged and the car was scraped along the passenger side, with the mirror broken.

But what turned a minor fender-bender into a political mystery is what unfolded next, as described in written statement from a witness and metro police, and in interviews with amaBhungane.

The BMW was driven by mayor Mzwandile Masina, breaking curfew in a City-owned car he had allegedly used without permission. He was removed from the scene before police investigations had finished and no witness statement was taken from him.

The truck driver, who has asked not to be named, told amaBhungane that he was driving an articulated truck, owned by SF Logistics.



Close to the turnoffs to the N12 and N3, he and his assistant in the passenger seat noticed in their rear-view mirrors that a car had appeared behind them, driving at high speed and swinging across lanes.



""Then I heard a bump and noticed a BMW next to my back tyre on my side.""

He slowed the truck, stopped it and got out. Two more cars stopped behind them, with men climbing out and shouting, ""Mayor, are you alright?""

Masina's wife

They then approached the truck driver, ""saying that I had hit the mayor and they were aggressive. The driver (Masina) approached and he was shouting at me, and people stopped him.""

As the heated confrontation continued, a woman appeared and identified herself to the truck driver as Masina's wife.

""She was very understanding when I explained what had happened and she took him away.""

By now, according to a witness, the scene bore no resemblance to a minor accident, with a number of metro police vehicles arriving, as well as the mayor's VIP protection entourage.

A metro policeman questioned both drivers and recorded a brief summary in an accident report, each driver blaming the other.

""Driver A (the truck driver) alleged he was travelling in the 2nd lane direction west when Vehicle ""B"" drive into him from the left side (illegible). Driver of Vehicle B (Masina) alleged he was driving west on N12 in the middle lane when Driver of Vehicle ""A"" come over to his lane and collided with him. The Driver of Vehicle ""A drive on and he manage to stop him.""

AmaBhungane asked the truck driver whether it was true that he failed to stop after the accident. He said that a heavily-laden goods truck could not be instantly stopped, but that he had slowed it down and stopped further up the road. A second officer arrived at the scene at 00:50.

By then, Masina had departed, and only the truck driver was present. The truck driver provided a sworn statement in which he made an additional allegation: ""Immediately I hear a sound, he bumped my tyre of my back trailer and I noticed he was drug [drunk].""

There is no equivalent sworn statement from Masina in the accident report file. The accident report says drunken driving was not suspected, nor was it tested for.

At 08:30 that morning, a more senior officer, Superintendent Kelobogile Thepa, was told about the accident. She discovered that the BMW did not belong to Masina, but was a ""blue light"" VIP vehicle allocated to the office of the mayor. Thepa was head of the Ekurhuleni Metro Police Department (EMPD) VIP protection unit at the time.



In a sworn statement attached to the investigations report, she said that after she found out that the mayor was driving an EMPD VIP vehicle, she notified the chief of police and requested him to intervene.

""He (chief of police) requested a meeting with the mayor where he explained processes of vehicle policy within the EMPD and asked if the mayor was aware that an EMPD vehicle was operated with a valid driving authorisation.

""The mayor expressed lack of knowledge with policies of the EMPD and promised never to operate an EMPD allocated vehicle as he is allocated officers for protection and conveyance.""

More questions than answers

In the 13 months since the accident, no further investigations have occurred. The official position is that it was a minor accident warranting no further examination. But a number of aspects certainly appear to deserve further attention:

Why was Masina allowed to leave the scene of an accident still under investigation?

Why did police not question or record why he was on the road at that hour during a curfew?

Why was he driving an EMPD car without permission?

Why was possible intoxication not investigated when the truck driver explicitly accused Masina of being drunk?

amaBhungane spoke to several people, who were either on the scene or were familiar with the investigation. No one would speak on the record, either because they were not authorised to speak to the media, or because they had been warned ""not to say anything relating to the incident ever again"".



Said one person: ""How can you investigate your boss objectively, a person who can make your life at work a misery. The reality is that there is a lot of intimidation happening at Ekurhuleni.""

Said another: ""The mayor has several personal cars. Why did he take this particular blue light car meant for police officers in the middle of the night? You need a permit to drive a car assigned to police. Is this not an abuse of state resources? When the accident happened, the mayor called his VIP entourage immediately and other senior EMPD officers, and yet this was a minor accident and straightforward.""

Mayor's office responds

The mayor's spokesperson, Phakamile Mbengashe, provided an explanation as to why the mayor was on the road during a curfew.

""On the evening of 20 August 2020, the executive mayor had just concluded a series of service delivery oversight visits in Vosloorus when he was notified of a medical emergency concerning a close family relative in Katlehong, which he urgently attended to. The family member subsequently passed away on the same day, 20 August 2020.""

Mbengashe provided a death certificate of the person showing she did indeed die on 20 August 2020.

The reason Masina was driving the VIP protection car himself was that: ""At the time of receiving the notification of the medical emergency, the executive mayor's protection unit had already completed their shift, and they were no longer in the company of the executive mayor.""

He claimed there was no intervention by the chief of police: ""All EMPD processes were followed in accordance with the department's policies.""

Mbengashe said the South African Local Government Association mayoral handbook, Section 5.1.3.1, dealing with terms for the use of official vehicles, leaves it to the discretion of the mayor to utilise a car at the expense of the municipality for any reasonable purpose.

Sharon Seretlo/Gallo Images

However, this section deals with a specific vehicle allocated for exclusive mayoral use, including for personal purposes, whereas it is not clear that the same provision applies to VIP protection vehicles assigned to the mayor's office.



Section 5.1.3.7 notes that: ""The use of any other municipal vehicle by the mayor is not permissible.""

Mbengashe said damage to the car had been minimal, isolated to only a rear mirror, and the mayor had covered the cost of the damage in his personal capacity.

However, pictures from the accident report show not only a broken mirror, but a long gash on the passenger side, running across both front and back doors.

If Masina blames the truck driver for the damage, why would he choose to pay for panel beating out of his own pocket?","['high', 'hushed', 'mayor', 'borrowed', 'driver', 'crash', 'masina', 'driving', 'blue', 'speed', 'car', 'mzwandile', 'empd', 'masinas', 'truck', 'light', 'vehicle', 'vip', 'accident']","Masina was at the wheel of a ""blue light"" VIP vehicle he allegedly had no permission to drive.

271,Alleged cybercrime: FG to arraign activist on Adoke’s complaint,"The Federal Government has filed criminal charges against a civil rights activist and chairman of the Human and Environmental Development Resources Centre, Lanre Suraj, at the Federal High Court in Abuja over allegations that he circulated the audio of a stage-managed phone interview with a former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoke.

According to TheCable, Suraj was also accused of circulating an allegedly forged email attributed to Adoke in which he was said to have communicated with JP Morgan over the OPL 245 transaction in 2011.

The government in the charges also accused Suraj of committing cybercrime.

No date has been fixed for Suraju’s arraignment in the suit marked FHC/ABJ/CR/370/2021 and dated October 8, 2021.

Adoke had petitioned the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba, over the circulation of the audio and email, which he said were forged to implicate him in the OPL 245 trial in Milan, Italy.

The Italian court has since dismissed allegations of corruption in the OPL 245 deal while the prosecutors are being investigated over alleged falsification and manipulation of evidence.

Tanker drivers begin strike Monday to protest bad roads

Petroleum tanker drivers will commence a strike on Monday over the deplorable state of the nation’s highways and other issues.

This was revealed by the South-West Zonal Chairman of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers, Mr Tayo Aboyeji, on Saturday.

The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the union has lost many lives and properties due to bad roads.

Aboyeji said that all tanker drivers from the union would withdraw their services nationwide.

He said, “This is not the first time that we will signify our intention to go on strike but we have to call it off because it will generally affect the majority of Nigerians but now our hands are tied.

“We are going on nationwide strike because of the deplorable and shameful state of our highways.

“When a truck loads petrol in Lagos, the drivers spend five to six days to get to Abuja because of the shameful state of the roads.

“All calls by the executive of the petroleum unions have fallen on the deaf ears of the government as the highways continue to deteriorate nationwide.

“The increasing rate of fire incidences involving petroleum tankers with accompanying massive destruction of lives and properties of our members and the general public is enough.

“This is because of the government’s failure to enforce installation of safety gadgets on tankers.

This will protect the inflammatory contents of their trucks from spilling over in a situation of road accident.

“We see the failure of the government in this regard as height of insensitivity to the lives of innocent Nigerians and the union cannot continue to hold its hands while our members are getting burnt everywhere and every day,” he said.

273,"‘Titane’ is a Twisted Exploration of Gender, Violence and Metal","Julia Ducournau’s Titane drips with blood and brake fluid, and mixes milk with motor oil. It centers, in its exacting crosshairs, the fragility of the flesh, the performance of gender, and palpable bodily anxieties, all while telling a bizarre story about a woman who fucks—and is impregnated by—a vintage Cadillac, before going on a murder spree and impersonating the long-lost son of a steroid-loving fire chief. Ducournau and cinematographer Ruben Impens capture all of this with a suitably madcap verve, painting gory violence with tongue-in-cheek whimsy, while zeroing in on the emotional core of operatic moments with laser precision. The result is a wildly visceral experience about transformation, one that lingers beneath the skin.

As a child, young Alexia (Adèle Guigue) has a fixation with cars. When her loud impression of an engine distracts her short-tempered father, she causes a road accident, resulting in a large chunk of her skull being replaced with titanium. Fast forward several years, and the adult Alexia (Agathe Rousselle) has become a famous dancer, whose provocative routine involves straddling the hood of a flaming Cadillac. Even before plunging its way into mind-boggling oddities, the film weaves together two male fetish objects—the car and the feminine form—but after briefly impersonating the male gaze, the camera swiftly ejects it from its purview, as Alexia respond to unwanted sexual advances with stark, discomforting violence.

Titane ★★★★

(4/4 stars)

Directed by: Julia Ducournau

Written by: Julia Ducournau

Starring: Agathe Rousselle, Vincent Lindon, Garance Marillier

Running time: 108 mins.

The violence in Titane is specifically penetrative, with hair sticks and chair legs thrust into ears and mouths. While this both subverts and strongly resembles sexual violence, Alexia’s bodily proximity to motor vehicles ensures that it also calls to mind car keys being twisted in ignitions. After all, one of these violent reprisals leads to her being revved up enough to have sex inside—and with—her vintage car, as it bounces up and down. The anatomical specifics are left out of frame; they don’t matter nearly as much as the glowing image of Alexia’s dripping sweat, or the velvet ropes she grasps, or the scene’s phantasmagorical ecstasy.

This is merely the beginning of the film’s physical, psychological and aesthetic overlap between (wo)man and machine. Alexia’s transhumanistic voyage was quite literally planted in her head in a moment of adolescent trauma, and it now resurges at a catalytic intersection of sex and violence. Her body keeps score during her unexpected pregnancy, during which she bleeds not blood, but a black, motor grease-like substance, and during which her womb becomes laced with metal, inviting questions of what parts of herself she might end up passing down to her child.

Alexia’s pregnancy anxiety also coincides with her evading the law by changing her appearance, in ways both as simple as shaving her eyebrows, and as complicated as breaking and misshaping her nose. She soon takes up residence with a lonely firefighter, Vincent (Vincent Lindon), a sad-clown patriarch past his prime, who pumps iron, and whose stoic rejection of grief primes him to accept, and believe, that Alexia is his long-lost son Adrien. Now living as a twenty-something man, Alexia binds her breasts and her pregnant belly, leading to winding scars akin to an ornate car decal, and to an uneasy balancing act. Not only must she put on a masculine performance—after years of performing her femininity for male eyes—but she must also work at a fire station drenched in homophobia and testosterone, while living with a new father figure whose love is both constrained and overbearing, and who eschews emotional expression in favour of physical dominance.

Alexia’s new predicament turns Titane into a transgender parable, not only because of the literal presence of binding and her need to “pass” as a man (which is directly threatened by her pregnancy), but because of how the film’s more inexplicable bodily anxieties are expressed. The specter of Alexia’s bodily mechanization causes her a dysphoric imbalance. It looms over her in a manner that prevents her from feeling wholly masculine or wholly feminine, two warring, binary modes of physical expression to which she is ultimately drawn, and which coalesce inside her in shocking and confusing ways, as the film blurs the lines between our gendered social understanding of pregnancy and technology—of feminine flesh and masculine metal.

This complicated dichotomy arises as early as Titane’s introductory scenes. High-contrast closeups of car parts dripping motor fluid are color timed to resemble festering wounds—these are also placed in close proximity to similar shots of Alexia on the operating table, with blood dripping from her new titanium skull. The film frequently invites aesthetic comparisons between the circulatory systems of human bodies and motorized creations; as Alexia’s story wears on, this visual overlap becomes more pronounced, especially as Ducournau slowly but surely maps it onto more specific car parts, and more specific body parts as well.

The film’s approach to gender and transformation bears resemblance to Isabel Fall’s unfairly maligned “I Sexually Identify as an Attack Helicopter,” a piercing sci-fi short story that explores transgender anxieties through a similar lens. The two texts were likely created independently of one another (the short story has been unavailable for some time), but they make for a fascinating pairing. Each one powerfully unsettles its audience, not only by placing gender’s social function under a microscope in a charged and violent setting, but by using vehicular bodies to magnify gender’s fragile and fluid relationship to the tangible and the physical.

This relationship is often expressed through motion—a fitting extension of the film’s vehicular themes—whether through Alexia’s hasty scrambles to cover up her body and her wounds, or through the contrast between her constrained stillness as the stone-faced Adrien and her eventual return to provocative dance movements to re-assert and re-ignite her femininity. She isn’t the only character to be framed this way; several young firemen are caught in a similar bodily battle. Pulsating musical frolic during nighttime celebrations offers them honest (if momentary) liberation, which clashes with their daytime routines involving their centered, masculine facades. Perhaps most moving of all is the way Vincent fits this mold, as a man torn between his steroid-fueled workouts—which he uses to suppress his emotions and reinforce his denial—and his submission to rhythmic intoxication, his soul set ablaze by a wash of neon light. It may not be long before Titane is programmed as a double feature alongside Beau Travail.

Throughout these physical and emotional transformations, Agathe Rousselle and Vincent Lindon throw themselves into their parts with full force. However, to discuss each role separately would be a purely logistical examination of an emotional whole, of which they form to two inextricable halves. As Alexia/Adrien and Fire Captain Vincent, they portray a remarkable balance between nigh-impenetrable emotional exteriors, and fleeting glimmers of vulnerable longing, for someone who truly understands them—their bodies, and their souls—a desire which Ducournau punctuates in the form of gorgeously detailed character portraits, often filmed in slow motion, amidst a sea of frenzy in an otherwise crowded frame.

Alexia and Vincent’s dynamic isn’t quite as simple as a man and a woman who gradually meet in the middle of a spectrum, but their respective self-actualizations are dependent on one another in unexpected ways. This paves the path for a relationship that starts out absurd, walks a fine line between surreal and familiar—including one particularly side-splitting use of “Macarena”—but soon gives way to complex intimacy, to surprising gentleness, and ultimately, to a stunning emotional crescendo that brings each of the film’s lofty themes full circle.

Strange, frequently haunting, occasionally hilarious and ultimately masterful, Titane is a journey whose head-spinning complications are a vital part of its emotional impact. Wrapping one’s mind around its outlandish elements demands actively re-calibrating cinematic expectations—and in the process, opening the mind and body to more introspective responses to the film’s most visceral, most nauseating and most thrilling scenes.

274,Threatened Swedish Mohammed cartoon artist and two police officers killed in road accident,"THE SWEDISH ARTIST Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Mohammed with a dog’s body brought death threats, has died in a road crash.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were travelling.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist’s partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Mohammed drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle.

He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

Vilks’ life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Mohammed with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favourable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

276,Swedish artist threatened for Muhammad sketch dies in crash,"Police say Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, has died in a traffic accident

STOCKHOLM -- Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since making a sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body in 2007, died in a weekend crash along with two police bodyguards, police said Monday. He was 75.

Vilks and two plainclothes police officers were killed in a head-on crash with a truck on Sunday afternoon, said Carina Persson, police chief for southern Sweden. All three died on the spot. The 45-year-old truck driver was flown to a hospital with serious injuries.

Persson said the police car, which had left Stockholm and was heading south, veered into the path of the truck and both vehicles burst into flames. The accident occurred near Markaryd, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Malmo, Sweden’s third largest city.

“There is nothing else for now that indicates that it was something else but a traffic accident,” Persson told a press conference.

Sweden’s top police chief, Anders Thornberg, said an investigation would take place, but was expected “to take a relatively long time.”

Sweden’s Culture Minister Amanda Lind called called it “an extremely tragic traffic accident.”

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before 2007, when he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Al-Qaida put a bounty on Vilks’ head. In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden.

Since that time Vilks was forced to live under police protection. As Lind put it Monday, “due to the fact that he made use of his freedom of expression and his artistic freedom.""

Over the years he continued to face threats to his life.

In 2014, a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to kill him.

The following year, a free-speech seminar that Vilks attended in Copenhagen, Denmark, was attacked by a lone gunman who killed a Danish film director and wounded three police officers.

Vilks, who was widely believed to have been the intended target of that 2015 attack, was whisked away unharmed by bodyguards. The gunman later killed a Jewish security guard outside a synagogue and wounded two more officers before he was killed in a firefight with police.

Police said Monday they did not know why the car drove into the wrong lane but they were investigating whether a tire might have exploded. The car transporting Vilks had puncture-proof tires, police said.

The accident happened on the north-south E4 highway Sunday afternoon. The unmarked police car apparently ploughed through a cable guardrail separating the north and south-bound lanes, senior police officer Stefan Siteus said at the news conference.

“We have found residues of tire on the E4 before the accident, and we are looking into the possibility that there could have been some kind of tire explosion,” Siteus said.

The vehicle weighed 4.5 tons, which could explain how the vehicle could drive through a cable guardrail, Siteus said. He added that the speed limit at the site was was 110 kilometers per hour (68 miles per hour). An ordinary large vehicle weighs less than 2 tons.

Born in 1946 in Helsingborg, in southern Sweden, Vilks worked as an artist for almost four decades, and rose to fame for challenging the boundaries of art through several controversial works.

His most famous pieces included “Nimis” — a sculpture of driftwood built without permission in Sweden’s Kullaberg nature reserve — as well as Prophet Muhammad drawings, including the one that showed the prophet as a dog.

Vilks initially planned to display the drawing at an exhibit at a Swedish cultural heritage center, but the drawing was removed over security concerns.

It went largely unnoticed until a Swedish newspaper printed the drawing with an editorial defending freedom of expression.

Several of his works, including driftwood sculptures and Mohammad drawings, including the one showing the Muslim prophet's head on the body of a dog, are currently on display in Warsaw, Poland. The works are being shown as part an exhibition curated by a right-wing director which aims to challenge left-wing political correctness.

STOCKHOLM -- The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

279,Dr Karl Covid-19 Australia: Scientist reveals what would happen if you drank vaccine,"Popular scientist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki has revealed what would happen if a person drank a Covid-19 vaccine instead of injecting it into the arm.

Dr Karl, who is dubbed 'the people's scientist', revealed stomach acid would likely destroy a Covid vaccine ingested via the mouth.

'[The vaccine] is optimised to work by a tiny amount of it being injected into the muscle and then various things happen there,' he explained during an interview on Triple M's The Danny Lakey Show.

'The vitamin is not that much, it's less than a mil, so I'm guessing on average, you could swallow it into your mouth, no worries, and it would go down into your esophagus, no worries.

'In the stomach, the extreme acidity may very well break it down and destroy it.'

Dr Karl Kruszelnicki said stomach acid would likely destroy a Covid vaccine if swallowed

Dr Karl, 73, said that while there are vaccines that are swallowed, including for polio, the health industry was moving towards vaccines administered via a spray.

'We're now moving to vaccines that work where the centre of all the action is, the lungs,' he said.

Host Lakey asked whether the vaccine would taste like medicine.

'It's only a mil, half a mil, so it would depend on the individual vaccine because there's so many,' Dr Karl said.

While a human being's stomach acid, enzymes and gut bacteria generally kill vaccine antigens, ingestible vaccines for diseases such as polio and rotavirus exist because both of those are gut pathogens.

Instructions on Covid-19 vaccines stress they should be administered intramuscularly (above) and not swallowed

It comes after the beloved science boffin took to TikTok to share an important message about the risk of dying from a Covid-19 vaccine compared to the disease itself.

'One in a million is the odds of dying from the AstraZeneca vaccine,' the expert said.

The figure is taken from Therapeutic Goods Administration data, which shows there have only been nine deaths linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine from more than 9.6 million doses administered across Australia as of August 29.

The vaccine has been linked to extremely rare blood clotting incidents but Dr Karl said the risk of dying in a road accident is still much higher at 40 deaths in a million.

He said the chance of dying from Covid-19 once infected is 22,000 in a million, 550 times higher than the risk of being killed on Australia's roads.

'22,000 to one. Those are really good odds,' Dr Karl said. 'That's why I got vaccinated as soon as possible - and so should you.'

During Melbourne's Covid-19 second wave there were 18,628 cases and 800 deaths as the virus ripped through Victoria's unvaccinated population in late 2020, according to the state's Department of Health.

Those figures equal a death rate of 42,000 in a million.","['happen', 'scientist', 'vaccine', 'million', 'mil', 'stomach', 'covid19', 'dying', 'dr', 'risk', 'australia', 'reveals', 'vaccines', 'karl', 'drank']","Popular scientist Dr Karl Kruszelnicki has revealed what would happen if a person drank a Covid-19 vaccine instead of injecting it into the arm.

280,Attorney sentenced for stealing R1.4 million in Road Accident Fund payouts meant for his clients,"An Eastern Cape attorney has been handed a suspended sentence of two years for stealing R1.4 million from his clients.

Sonwabo Archibald Hermanus, 55, was ordered to pay back the R1.4 million stolen over a period of five years.

The sentence is wholly suspended for five years, provided that he does not commit the same offence during the suspension period.

An Eastern Cape attorney has been sentenced to two years imprisonment for stealing R1.4 million in Road Accident Fund (RAF) payouts made to his clients.



Sonwabo Archibald Hermanus' sentence was wholly suspended for five years, provided that he does not commit the same offence during the suspension period.

The Mthatha Serious Commercial Specialised Crime Court also ordered Hermanus, 55, to pay back the R1.4 million over a period of five years.

The Hawks said the R1.4 million was deposited by the RAF into Hermanus' trust account in 2013.

The money was meant for Hermanus' clients.

A warrant of arrest was issued, and Mariri handed himself over at the Hawks' Serious Commercial Crime Investigation office in Pretoria on Thursday.



""The investigation team formally charged him with theft and took him to court,"" said Mulamu.

Mariri was granted R10 000 bail, and the case was postponed to 22 October 2021 for further investigation.

A council sitting will take place on Friday when Moerane is expected to be elected uncontested.

He is poised to replace the late Jolidee Matongo, who died in a car accident two months after taking up the post.

Johannesburg MMC for Environment and Infrastructure Services Mpho Moerane has been endorsed by the ANC's Johannesburg regional executive committee as the party's candidate for City of Johannesburg mayor.

News24 understands that Moerane was ""unanimously"" endorsed at committee meeting on Tuesday after the committee received advice from the legal teams of the Johannesburg ANC and provincial Cogta department.

The committee sought the legal opinion shortly after former mayor Jolidee Matongo died in a road accident two months after taking the post. Matongo was among the longest-serving members of the committee and was previously appointed by late mayor Geoff Makhubo to serve as the City of Johannesburg's MMC for Finance.

283,Dignity for disabled people: They put my little brother in an old people's home... aged 26,"My little brother Omar has always been fearless, pretty much. I'm two years older, but when we were children he was always the first to climb a tree or jump a fence.

I still call him my little brother – but by the time he was in his 20s he was 6ft 1in, with a 14-stone muscular frame who had trained in the British Army. He became a bit of a local hero, too.

He once came to the rescue of a woman who was being robbed at knifepoint – chasing her assailant away.

Yet today, at the age of 33, following a devastating road accident, he faces spending the rest of his life consigned to an old people's home, alongside dementia patients in their 80s.

Eight years ago, Omar's motorbike skidded over a manhole cover, and he was catapulted into a lamp post then a telephone box.

He sustained 27 bone fractures, severed nerves in the neck, arm and back, dislocated his skull from his spine, became deaf in one ear and suffered four brain haemorrhages.

Omar Moustapha , now 33, with his sister, Mariam. Eight years ago, his motorbike skidded over a manhole cover, and he was catapulted into a lamp post then a telephone box. He sustained 27 bone fractures, severed nerves in the neck, arm and back, dislocated his skull from his spine, became deaf in one ear and suffered four brain haemorrhages

He wasn't expected to wake up from a coma, which lasted for a fortnight – but he did.

He spent 16 months in hospital where he had 30 operations, as well as multiple psychiatric assessments as the brain damage has left him with long-term mental health problems.

Omar, my heroic brother, has made remarkable steps to recovery – yet he can't walk longer than a few metres unaided and needs help to wash, dress and do other day-to-day things.

Damage to the nerves in his throat mean he is vulnerable to spasms when eating and drinking, so needs help to prevent him from choking. We've had inadequate help from local healthcare teams, so he is now reliant on our mother, who is 64, and 35-year-old me.

My family has tried everything to get the care Omar desperately needs to live as independently as possible. Ealing Council, in West London, made this impossible from the beginning.

Every request was met with push back. We've written to our MP, James Murray, submitted reports by GPs, surgeons and psychiatrists to support the case for extra help – to no avail.

Mariam pictured with Omar on a night out in 2009. 'My family has tried everything to get the care Omar desperately needs to live as independently as possible. Ealing Council, in West London, made this impossible from the beginning,' says Mariam

The council's only suggestion is for him to go into an old people's home, because specialist services for disabled younger people are so scarce. It's not something he wants to do, not least because he was previously put in one and he felt so desperate he tried to take his own life.

Just over two years ago, The Mail on Sunday revealed that thousands of young Britons with disabilities were languishing in nursing homes.

One woman, 46-year-old Nina Thair, an assistant headteacher from Brighton, was placed in a nursing home for dementia patients when a multiple sclerosis relapse left her unable to live independently. The local council refused to pay the fees – leaving Nina to foot the £4,800 monthly bill.

That shocking story marked the launch of The Mail on Sunday's Dignity For Disabled People campaign, in which we highlighted shocking injustices dealt to some of the most vulnerable people in our society.

And all the while, the nightmarish situation had been playing out in my own house for the previous five years. Despite my role as one of The Mail on Sunday's fitness experts, I haven't written about this until now.

Omar didn't want people to know that he can't cope on his own. But the situation has become so desperate that we have little choice but to speak out.

I hope by doing so people will see that if it can happen to a family like ours, it could happen to anyone.

Omar was just 24 when he became one of the 1.2 million Britons with severe disabilities. I'll never forget the sight of the policeman at the doorstep, and the heart-stopping moment he told us my brother had been airlifted to hospital.

The officer took us to his bedside, while my mother, my younger sister – who has Down's syndrome –and I sat in silence, terrified.

We slept by Omar's bedside for two weeks, preparing for his heart to stop at any moment, while doctors explained that if he did wake up, for the rest of his life he'd be reliant on a wheelchair and an oxygen tank to breathe.

Then came the miraculous moment he began to breathe without a machine – and we realised he might make it after all.

After being discharged from hospital, his care at a rehabilitation centre in Banstead, Surrey, was exemplary. The experts there were teaching him how to, quite literally, get back on his feet.

And it seemed to be working. Having been told he'd never walk again, he'd managed to make it down an entire corridor, picking up one leg at a time using his left arm – the only limb he still has slight feeling in.

It's a fact More than 400,000 wheelchair-users in England live in homes that are deemed inaccessible, claims housing association Habinteg.

The number of disabled people waiting for suitable housing has risen by ten per cent since 2017 to roughly 120,000. Advertisement

But one day the doctor entered his room and told us the local council had cut funding for his care. He had to be out within the week.

Omar had recently split from his wife, with whom he had a two- month-old son and shared a flat, so we had planned that, at some point when he was much better, he'd return to the family home, where my mother and I could look after him. But we weren't ready yet.

His doctors told us our three-bedroom house would need a complete overhaul to meet Omar's needs: railings installed to help him get up and down stairs, a wet room on the ground floor and walls knocked through to create more space. We begged for more time. The answer was no.

Instead, Omar would have to be admitted to the local nursing home, where he'd receive 24-hour care, paid for by the local council.

He was inconsolable, and slumped into a deep depression, repeating 'my life is over,' again and again.

He moved there in late 2015. The elderly man in the room opposite would scream expletives throughout the day and into the night. Many others were dying.

While the rehab team in Surrey had worked hard to get Omar moving again, here, staff did little to help him.

He grew angry, began hitting his head against the walls, throwing objects in frustration and became verbally aggressive.

This behaviour would have left the old Omar mortified – he could be hot-headed, but never, ever threatening. The brain haemorrhages have made him prone to outbursts.

After a few days he phoned our mother, begging us to come and collect him. Back at home, he got even worse.

He could barely balance, as nerve damage to his ankles has made his feet 'lifeless'. Sometimes he resorted to crawling back up the stairs, to be safe.

The council provided a wheelchair, but due to the lack of feeling in his arms he can't use it independently. Splints don't help either, as they cause him pain. Showering became more infrequent – the ordeal of having his mother or sister assist him proved embarrassing.

Terrified of the mountain that was the staircase, he chose to spend most days in his bedroom, increasingly depressed.

According to Government guidance, those with an ongoing healthcare need, such as Omar, qualify for NHS support – but funding and staffing problems mean patients often face delays of several years before accessing essential care and equipment.

A social worker's assessment in 2015 concluded that Omar needed 24-hour assistance and that, given his age and mental health risk, it was important he retained as much independence as possible.

The council agreed to find Omar his own accessible flat in the local area – but even this has been impossible.

Omar is desperate for his own space, away from his mother and sister. Our once enviably close brother-sister relationship is in tatters.

Omar, aged five, and elder sister Mariam playing on go-karts in 1994. She always admired his fearless nature before his accident in 2013

Having to ask his sister to be on hand should he fall when using the toilet is beyond humiliating. And watching me go out to work and enjoy dinners with friends, while his only outing was to the hospital, to have his wounds dressed, has been excruciating.

Omar preferred not to talk to me, or ask for help.

The council suggested sending carers three times a day to help with cleaning, cooking and personal care duties, when my mother and I couldn't manage.

But Omar's brain injury means he is paranoid. He gets aggressive around strangers in his house.

In 2017, the council offered Omar a flat 20 minutes from home – but in the heart of a notorious estate.

At the viewing, we learnt the next-door neighbour had recently been released from prison.

We explained to the council that we didn't feel it would be safe, given my brother's physical and mental vulnerabilities. It also suggested a one-bedroom flat, despite Omar's team of consultants warning against him living alone.

Even when The Mail on Sunday contacted Ealing council to clarify details, they continued to claim he did not require a live-in carer, which made him ineligible for a two-bedroom property.

We've struggled on over the past few years, my mother and I doing alternate shifts, with Omar becoming more and more disengaged with life.

Then, in February last year, while I was out working, he had a bad fall down the stairs and was screaming in pain. In a fury, he dragged himself into my mother's bedroom, grabbed hold of some glass vases on the shelves and smashed them.

Then he attempted suicide in front of her. She called the police, who took him to a psychiatric hospital.

The psychiatrist prescribed antidepressants, and wrote a strongly worded letter to health chiefs in charge of Omar's care, warning of the urgency of his living situation and that he should not be left to live alone.

He came home a few days later, and 18 months on, we're in the same situation. Omar's life has become what he describes as 'a hamster wheel'. 'Every day I wake up, I'm just waiting to go back to sleep. It's killing me inside.'

When our local MP approached the council, asking for a meeting to discuss Omar's case, he was told: 'Sorry, no meetings with politicians at the moment, because of Covid.'

No Zoom meeting, or phone call. Nothing. Meanwhile, Omar's physical condition has taken another dive. In April he underwent another operation on his sciatic nerve, which stretches from the leg to the lower spine.

Ever since, his balance has got worse and he hasn't ventured out of the house in five months, until the end of last week, in the run-up to the publication of this article – which seems to have offered him new hope.

When he found out I'd be writing it, he wasn't thrilled, but agreed because of the comfort he knew it would offer thousands in a similar position. He's made peace with the fact his secret will soon be out. Finally, his voice will be heard.

We can only hope those at the top of the chain are listening.

In a statement, Ealing council said: 'Social housing is in very short supply in Ealing, with more than 11,300 households waiting for a council home.

'We ensure homes go to those who need them most by allocating our finite resources according to priority.

'Mr Moustapha has been in our second-highest priority allocation band since 2016.'

Police and the SPCA are investigating what's been called the ""brutal slaughter"" of 11 rabbits and ducks at an animal shelter in Dairy Flat, Auckland.

Founder of Pixies Animal Rescue Charmain Wolmarans said the rescue animals were killed overnight after a break-in, leaving staff and animals shocked and distressed.

SPCA national inspectorate manager Alan Wilson said the animals appear to have been deliberately killed.

""We are shocked and appalled by this incident, and condemn any senseless act of violence towards defenceless animals,"" he said.

Police confirmed the burglary and said no arrests have been made but inquiries are continuing.

Wolmarans is calling for anyone with information to pass it on to the police or SPCA.

In a Facebook post this morning, she said the shelter needs help to move animals to safety in case there are further attacks. They will not be taking any new animals until the situation is more stable.

Originally from South Africa, Wolmarans started Pixies in 2012 in memory of her daughter who was killed in a road accident at the age of 18.

The animal rescue cares for nearly 400 animals every year.

28 September, 2021 15 min to read

In this article, we'll train the car to do self-parking using a genetic algorithm.

We'll create the 1st generation of cars with random genomes that will behave something like this:

On the ≈40th generation the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot:

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

Yeah-yeah, the cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so be merciful and give the cars some space to grow :D

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The genetic algorithm for this project is implemented in TypeScript. The full genetic source code will be shown in this article, but you may also find the final code examples in the Evolution Simulator repository.

We're going to use a genetic algorithm for the particular task of evolving cars' genomes. However, this article only touches on the basics of the algorithm and is by no means a complete guide to the genetic algorithm topic.

Having that said, let's deep dive into more details...

The Plan

Step-by-step we're going to break down a high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 bits (finding the optimal car genome).

Here is what we're going to do:

💪🏻 Give the muscles (engine, steering wheel) to the car so that it could move towards the parking spot. 👀 Give the eyes (sensors) to the car so that it could see the obstacles around. 🧠 Give the brain to the car that will control the muscles (movements) based on what the car sees (obstacles via sensors). The brain will be simply a pure function movements = f(sensors) . 🧬 Evolve the brain to do the right moves based on the sensors input. This is where we will apply a genetic algorithm. Generation after generation our brain function movements = f(sensors) will learn how to move the car towards the parking spot.

Giving the muscles to the car

To be able to move, the car would need ""muscles"". Let's give the car two types of muscles:

Engine muscle - allows the car to move ↓ back, ↑ forth, or ◎ stand steel (neutral gear) Steering wheel muscle - allows the car to turn ← left, → right, or ◎ go straight while moving

With these two muscles the car can perform the following movements:

In our case, the muscles are receivers of the signals that come from the brain once every 100ms (milliseconds). Based on the value of the brain's signal the muscles act differently. We'll cover the ""brain"" part below, but for now, let's say that our brain may send only 3 possible signals to each muscle: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

type MuscleSignal = - 1 | 0 | 1 ;

For example, the brain may send the signal with the value of +1 to the engine muscle and it will start moving the car forward. The signal -1 to the engine moves the car backward. At the same time, if the brain will send the signal of -1 to the steering wheel muscle, it will turn the car to the left, etc.

Here is how the brain signal values map to the muscle actions in our case:

Muscle Signal = -1 Signal = 0 Signal = +1 Engine ↓ Backward ◎ Neutral ↑ Forward Steering wheel ← Left ◎ Straight → Right

You may use the Evolution Simulator and try to park the car manually to see how the car muscles work. Every time you press one of the WASD keyboard keys (or use a touch-screen joystick) you send these -1 , 0 , or +1 signals to the engine and steering wheel muscles.

Giving the eyes to the car

Before our car will learn how to do self-parking using its muscles, it needs to be able to ""see"" the surroundings. Let's give it the 8 eyes in a form of distance sensors:

Each sensor can detect the obstacle in a distance range of 0-4m (meters).

(meters). Each sensor reports the latest information about the obstacles it ""sees"" to the car's ""brain"" every 100ms .

. Whenever the sensor doesn't see any obstacles it reports the value of 0 . On the contrary, if the value of the sensor is small but not zero (i.e. 0.01m ) it would mean that the obstacle is close.

You may use the Evolution Simulator and see how the color of each sensor changes based on how close the obstacle is.

type Sensors = number [ ] ;

Giving the brain to the car

At this moment, our car can ""see"" and ""move"", but there is no ""coordinator"", that would transform the signals from the ""eyes"" to the proper movements of the ""muscles"". We need to give the car a ""brain"".

Brain input

As an input from the sensors, every 100ms the brain will be getting 8 float numbers, each one in range of [0...4] . For example, the input might look like this:

const sensors : Sensors = [ s0 , s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 , s7 ] ;

Brain output

Every 100ms the brain should produce two integers as an output:

One number as a signal for the engine: engineSignal One number as a signal for the steering wheel: wheelSignal

Each number should be of the type MuscleSignal and might take one of three values: -1 , 0 , or +1 .

Brain formulas/functions

Keeping in mind the brain's input and output mentioned above we may say that the brain is just a function:

const { engineSignal , wheelSignal } = brainToMuscleSignal ( brainFunction ( sensors ) ) ;

Where brainToMuscleSignal() is a function that converts raw brain signals (any float number) to muscle signals (to -1 , 0 , or +1 number) so that muscles could understand it. We'll implement this converter function below.

The main question now is what kind of a function the brainFunction() is.

To make the car smarter and its movements to be more sophisticated we could go with a Multilayer Perceptron. The name is a bit scary but this is a simple Neural Network with a basic architecture (think of it as a big formula with many parameters/coefficients).

I've covered Multilayer Perceptrons with a bit more details in my homemade-machine-learning, machine-learning-experiments, and nano-neuron projects. You may even challenge that simple network to recognize your written digits.

However, to avoid the introduction of a whole new concept of Neural Networks, we'll go with a much simpler approach and we'll use two Linear Polynomials with multiple variables (to be more precise, each polynomial will have exactly 8 variables, since we have 8 sensors) which will look something like this:

engineSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( e0 * s0 ) + ( e1 * s1 ) + ... + ( e7 * s7 ) + e8 ) wheelSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( ( w0 * s0 ) + ( w1 * s1 ) + ... + ( w7 * s7 ) + w8 )

Where:

[s0, s1, ..., s7] - the 8 variables, which are the 8 sensor values. These are dynamic.

- the variables, which are the sensor values. These are dynamic. [e0, e1, ..., e8] - the 9 coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static.

- the coefficients for the engine polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static. [w0, w1, ..., w8] - the 9 coefficients for the steering wheel polynomial. These the car will need to learn, and they will be static

The cost of using the simpler function for the brain will be that the car won't be able to learn some sophisticated moves and also won't be able to generalize well and adapt well to unknown surroundings. But for our particular parking lot and for the sake of demonstrating the work of a genetic algorithm it should still be enough.

We may implement the generic polynomial function in the following way:

type Coefficients = number [ ] ; const linearPolynomial = ( coefficients : Coefficients , variables : number [ ] ) : number => { if ( coefficients . length !== ( variables . length + 1 ) ) { throw new Error ( 'Incompatible number of polynomial coefficients and variables' ) ; } let result = 0 ; coefficients . forEach ( ( coefficient : number , coefficientIndex : number ) => { if ( coefficientIndex < variables . length ) { result += coefficient * variables [ coefficientIndex ] ; } else { result += coefficient } } ) ; return result ; } ;

The car's brain in this case will consist of two polynomials and will look like this:

const engineSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( engineCoefficients , sensors ) ) ; const wheelSignal : MuscleSignal = brainToMuscleSignal ( linearPolynomial ( wheelCoefficients , sensors ) ) ;

The output of a linearPolynomial() function is a float number. The brainToMuscleSignal() function need to convert the wide range of floats to three particular integers, and it will do it in two steps:

Convert the float of a wide range (i.e. 0.456 or 3673.45 or -280 ) to the float in a range of (0...1) (i.e. 0.05 or 0.86 ) Convert the float in a range of (0...1) to one of three integer values of -1 , 0 , or +1 . For example, the floats that are close to 0 will be converted to -1 , the floats that are close to 0.5 will be converted to 0 , and the floats that are close to 1 will be converted to 1 .

To do the first part of the conversion we need to introduce a Sigmoid Function which implements the following formula:

It converts the wide range of floats (the x axis) to float numbers with a limited range of (0...1) (the y axis). This is exactly what we need.

Here is how the conversion steps would look on the Sigmoid graph.

The implementation of two conversion steps mentioned above would look like this:

const sigmoid = ( x : number ) : number => { return 1 / ( 1 + Math . E ** - x ) ; } ; const sigmoidToMuscleSignal = ( sigmoidValue : number , margin : number = 0.4 ) : MuscleSignal => { if ( sigmoidValue < ( 0.5 - margin ) ) { return - 1 ; } if ( sigmoidValue > ( 0.5 + margin ) ) { return 1 ; } return 0 ; } ; const brainToMuscleSignal = ( rawBrainSignal : number ) : MuscleSignal => { const normalizedBrainSignal = sigmoid ( rawBrainSignal ) ; return sigmoidToMuscleSignal ( normalizedBrainSignal ) ; }

Car's genome (DNA)

☝🏻 The main conclusion from the ""Eyes"", ""Muscles"" and ""Brain"" sections above should be this: the coefficients [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] defines the behavior of the car. These 18 numbers together form the unique car's Genome (or car's DNA).

Car genome in a decimal form

Let's join the [e0, e1, ..., e8] and [w0, w1, ..., w8] brain coefficients together to form a car's genome in a decimal form:

const carGenomeBase10 = [ e0 , e1 , ... , e8 , w0 , w1 , ... , w8 ] ;

Car genome in a binary form

Let's move one step deeper (to the level of the genes) and convert the decimal numbers of the car's genome to the binary format (to the plain 1 s and 0 s).

I've described in the detail the process of converting the floating-point numbers to binary numbers in the Binary representation of the floating-point numbers article. You might want to check it out if the code in this section is not clear.

Here is a quick example of how the floating-point number may be converted to the 16 bits binary number (again, feel free to read this first if the example is confusing):

In our case, to reduce the genome length, we will convert each floating coefficient to the non-standard 10 bits binary number ( 1 sign bit, 4 exponent bits, 5 fraction bits).

We have 18 coefficients in total, every coefficient will be converted to 10 bits number. It means that the car's genome will be an array of 0 s and 1 s with a length of 18 * 10 = 180 bits .

For example, for the genome in a decimal format that was mentioned above, its binary representation would look like this:

type Gene = 0 | 1 ; type Genome = Gene [ ] ; const genome : Genome = [ 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , ] ;

Oh my! The binary genome looks so cryptic. But can you imagine, that these 180 zeroes and ones alone define how the car behaves in the parking lot! It's like you hacked someone's DNA and know what each gene means exactly. Amazing!

By the way, you may see the exact values of genomes and coefficients for the best performing car on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Here is the source code that performs the conversion from binary to decimal format for the floating-point numbers (the brain will need it to decode the genome and to produce the muscle signals based on the genome data):

type Bit = 0 | 1 ; type Bits = Bit [ ] ; type PrecisionConfig = { signBitsCount : number , exponentBitsCount : number , fractionBitsCount : number , totalBitsCount : number , } ; type PrecisionConfigs = { custom : PrecisionConfig , } ; const precisionConfigs : PrecisionConfigs = { custom : { signBitsCount : 1 , exponentBitsCount : 4 , fractionBitsCount : 5 , totalBitsCount : 10 , } , } ; function bitsToFloat ( bits : Bits , precisionConfig : PrecisionConfig ) : number { const { signBitsCount , exponentBitsCount } = precisionConfig ; const sign = ( - 1 ) ** bits [ 0 ] ; const exponentBias = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - 1 ) - 1 ; const exponentBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount , signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const exponentUnbiased = exponentBits . reduce ( ( exponentSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** ( exponentBitsCount - bitIndex - 1 ) ; return exponentSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; const exponent = exponentUnbiased - exponentBias ; const fractionBits = bits . slice ( signBitsCount + exponentBitsCount ) ; const fraction = fractionBits . reduce ( ( fractionSoFar : number , currentBit : Bit , bitIndex : number ) => { const bitPowerOfTwo = 2 ** - ( bitIndex + 1 ) ; return fractionSoFar + currentBit * bitPowerOfTwo ; } , 0 , ) ; return sign * ( 2 ** exponent ) * ( 1 + fraction ) ; } function bitsToFloat10 ( bits : Bits ) : number { return bitsToFloat ( bits , precisionConfigs . custom ) ; }

Brain function working with binary genome

Previously our brain function was working with the decimal form of engineCoefficients and wheelCoefficients polynomial coefficients directly. However, these coefficients are now encoded in the binary form of a genome. Let's add a decodeGenome() function that will extract coefficients from the genome and let's rewrite our brain functions:

const CAR_SENSORS_NUM = 8 ; const BIAS_UNITS = 1 ; const GENES_PER_NUMBER = precisionConfigs . custom . totalBitsCount ; const ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM = ( CAR_SENSORS_NUM + BIAS_UNITS ) * GENES_PER_NUMBER ; const GENOME_LENGTH = ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ; type DecodedGenome = { engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients , } const genomeToNumbers = ( genome : Genome , genesPerNumber : number ) : number [ ] => { if ( genome . length % genesPerNumber !== 0 ) { throw new Error ( 'Wrong number of genes in the numbers genome' ) ; } const numbers : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let numberIndex = 0 ; numberIndex < genome . length ; numberIndex += genesPerNumber ) { const number : number = bitsToFloat10 ( genome . slice ( numberIndex , numberIndex + genesPerNumber ) ) ; numbers . push ( number ) ; } return numbers ; } ; const decodeGenome = ( genome : Genome ) : DecodedGenome => { const engineGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( 0 , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM ) ; const wheelsGenes : Gene [ ] = genome . slice ( ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ENGINE_FORMULA_GENES_NUM + WHEELS_FORMULA_GENES_NUM , ) ; const engineFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( engineGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; const wheelsFormulaCoefficients : Coefficients = genomeToNumbers ( wheelsGenes , GENES_PER_NUMBER ) ; return { engineFormulaCoefficients , wheelsFormulaCoefficients , } ; } ; export const getEngineMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { engineFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ; export const getWheelsMuscleSignal = ( genome : Genome , sensors : Sensors ) : MuscleSignal => { const { wheelsFormulaCoefficients : coefficients } = decodeGenome ( genome ) ; const rawBrainSignal = linearPolynomial ( coefficients , sensors ) ; return brainToMuscleSignal ( rawBrainSignal ) ; } ;

Self-driving car problem statement

☝🏻 So, finally, we've got to the point when the high-level problem of making the car to be a self-parking car is broken down to the straightforward optimization problem of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeros (finding the ""good enough"" car's genome). Sounds simple, doesn't it?

Naive approach

We could approach the problem of finding the ""good enough"" genome in a naive way and try out all possible combinations of genes:

[0, ..., 0, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 0, 1] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 0] , and then... [0, ..., 1, 1] , and then... ...

But, let's do some math. With 180 bits and with each bit being equal either to 0 or to 1 we would have 2^180 (or 1.53 * 10^54 ) possible combinations. Let's say we would need to give 15s to each car to see if it will park successfully or not. Let's also say that we may run a simulation for 10 cars at once. Then we would need 15 * (1.53 * 10^54) / 10 = 2.29 * 10^54 [seconds] which is 7.36 * 10^46 [years] . Pretty long waiting time. Just as a side thought, it is only 2.021 * 10^3 [years] that have passed after Christ was born.

Genetic approach

We need a faster algorithm to find the optimal value of the genome. This is where the genetic algorithm comes to the rescue. We might not find the best value of the genome, but there is a chance that we may find the optimal value of it. And, what is, more importantly, we don't need to wait that long. With the Evolution Simulator I was able to find a pretty good genome within 24 [hours] .

Genetic algorithm basics

A genetic algorithms (GA) inspired by the process of natural selection, and are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as crossover, mutation and selection.

The problem of finding the ""good enough"" combination of genes for the car looks like an optimization problem, so there is a good chance that GA will help us here.

We're not going to cover a genetic algorithm in all details, but on a high level here are the basic steps that we will need to do:

CREATE – the very first generation of cars can't come out of nothing, so we will generate a set of random car genomes (set of binary arrays with the length of 180 ) at the very beginning. For example, we may create ~1000 cars. With a bigger population the chances to find the optimal solution (and to find it faster) increase. SELECT - we will need to select the fittest individuums out of the current generation for further mating (see the next step). The fitness of each individuum will be defined based on the fitness function, which in our case, will show how close the car approached the target parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. MATE – simply saying we will allow the selected ""♂ father-cars"" to have ""sex"" with the selected ""♀ mother-cars"" so that their genomes could mix in a ~50/50 proportion and produce ""♂♀ children-cars"" genomes. The idea is that the children cars might get better (or worse) in self-parking, by taking the best (or the worst) bits from their parents. MUTATE - during the mating process some genes may randomly mutate ( 1 s and 0 s in child genome may flip). This may bring a wider variety of children genomes and, thus, a wider variety of children cars behavior. Imagine that the 1st bit was accidentally set to 0 for all ~1000 cars. The only way to try the car with the 1st bit being set to 1 is through the random mutations. At the same time, extensive mutations may ruin healthy genomes. Go to ""Step 2"" unless the number of generations has reached the limit (i.e. 100 generations have passed) or unless the top-performing individuums have reached the expected fitness function value (i.e. the best car has approached the parking spot closer than 1 meter ). Otherwise, quit.

Evolving the car's brain using a Genetic Algorithm

Before launching the genetic algorithm let's go and create the functions for the ""CREATE"", ""SELECT"", ""MATE"" and ""MUTATE"" steps of the algorithm.

Functions for the CREATE step

The createGeneration() function will create an array of random genomes (a.k.a. population or generation) and will accept two parameters:

generationSize - defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation.

- defines the size of the generation. This generation size will be preserved from generation to generation. genomeLength - defines the genome length of each individuum in the cars population. In our case, the length of the genome will be 180 .

There is a 50/50 chance for each gene of a genome to be either 0 or 1 .

type Generation = Genome [ ] ; type GenerationParams = { generationSize : number , genomeLength : number , } ; function createGenome ( length : number ) : Genome { return new Array ( length ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? 0 : 1 ) ) ; } function createGeneration ( params : GenerationParams ) : Generation { const { generationSize , genomeLength } = params ; return new Array ( generationSize ) . fill ( null ) . map ( ( ) => createGenome ( genomeLength ) ) ; }

Functions for the MUTATE step

The mutate() function will mutate some genes randomly based on the mutationProbability value.

For example, if the mutationProbability = 0.1 then there is a 10% chance for each genome to be mutated. Let's say if we would have a genome of length 10 that looks like [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] , then after the mutation, there will be a chance that 1 gene will be mutated and we may get a genome that might look like [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0] .

type Probability = number ; function mutate ( genome : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability ) : Genome { for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < genome . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { const gene : Gene = genome [ geneIndex ] ; const mutatedGene : Gene = gene === 0 ? 1 : 0 ; genome [ geneIndex ] = Math . random ( ) < mutationProbability ? mutatedGene : gene ; } return genome ; }

Functions for the MATE step

The mate() function will accept the father and the mother genomes and will produce two children. We will imitate the real-world scenario and also do the mutation during the mating.

Each bit of the child genome will be defined based on the values of the correspondent bit of the father's or mother's genomes. There is a 50/50% probability that the child will inherit the bit of the father or the mother. For example, let's say we have genomes of length 4 (for simplicity reasons):

Father's genome: [0, 0, 1, 1] Mother's genome: [0, 1, 0, 1] ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ Possible kid #1: [0, 1, 1, 1] Possible kid #2: [0, 0, 1, 1]

In the example above the mutation were not taken into account.

Here is the function implementation:

function mate ( father : Genome , mother : Genome , mutationProbability : Probability , ) : [ Genome , Genome ] { if ( father . length !== mother . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Cannot mate different species' ) ; } const firstChild : Genome = [ ] ; const secondChild : Genome = [ ] ; for ( let geneIndex = 0 ; geneIndex < father . length ; geneIndex += 1 ) { firstChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; secondChild . push ( Math . random ( ) < 0.5 ? father [ geneIndex ] : mother [ geneIndex ] ) ; } return [ mutate ( firstChild , mutationProbability ) , mutate ( secondChild , mutationProbability ) , ] ; }

Functions for the SELECT step

To select the fittest individuums for further mating we need a way to find out the fitness of each genome. To do this we will use a so-called fitness function.

The fitness function is always related to the particular task that we try to solve, and it is not generic. In our case, the fitness function will measure the distance between the car and the parking spot. The closer the car to the parking spot, the fitter it is. We will implement the fitness function a bit later, but for now, let's introduce the interface for it:

type FitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) => number ;

Now, let's say we have fitness values for each individuum in the population. Let's also say that we sorted all individuums by their fitness values so that the first individuums are the strongest ones. How should we select the fathers and the mothers from this array? We need to do the selection in a way, that the higher the fitness value of the individuum, the higher the chances of this individuum being selected for mating. The weightedRandom() function will help us with this.

const weightedRandom = < T > ( items : T [ ] , weights : number [ ] ) : { item : T , index : number } => { if ( items . length !== weights . length ) { throw new Error ( 'Items and weights must be of the same size' ) ; } const cumulativeWeights : number [ ] = [ ] ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < weights . length ; i += 1 ) { cumulativeWeights [ i ] = weights [ i ] + ( cumulativeWeights [ i - 1 ] || 0 ) ; } const maxCumulativeWeight = cumulativeWeights [ cumulativeWeights . length - 1 ] ; const randomNumber = maxCumulativeWeight * Math . random ( ) ; for ( let i = 0 ; i < items . length ; i += 1 ) { if ( cumulativeWeights [ i ] >= randomNumber ) { return { item : items [ i ] , index : i , } ; } } return { item : items [ items . length - 1 ] , index : items . length - 1 , } ; } ;

The usage of this function is pretty straightforward. Let's say you really like bananas and want to eat them more often than strawberries. Then you may call const fruit = weightedRandom(['banana', 'strawberry'], [9, 1]) , and in ≈9 out of 10 cases the fruit variable will be equal to banana , and only in ≈1 out of 10 times it will be equal to strawberry .

To avoid losing the best individuums (let's call them champions) during the mating process we may also introduce a so-called longLivingChampionsPercentage parameter. For example, if the longLivingChampionsPercentage = 10 , then 10% of the best cars from the previous population will be carried over to the new generation. You may think about it as there are some long-living individuums that can live a long life and see their children and even grandchildren.

Here is the actual implementation of the select() function:

type Percentage = number ; type SelectionOptions = { mutationProbability : Probability , longLivingChampionsPercentage : Percentage , } ; function select ( generation : Generation , fitness : FitnessFunction , options : SelectionOptions , ) { const { mutationProbability , longLivingChampionsPercentage , } = options ; const newGeneration : Generation = [ ] ; const oldGeneration = [ ... generation ] ; oldGeneration . sort ( ( genomeA : Genome , genomeB : Genome ) : number => { const fitnessA = fitness ( genomeA ) ; const fitnessB = fitness ( genomeB ) ; if ( fitnessA < fitnessB ) { return 1 ; } if ( fitnessA > fitnessB ) { return - 1 ; } return 0 ; } ) ; const longLiversCount = Math . floor ( longLivingChampionsPercentage * oldGeneration . length / 100 ) ; if ( longLiversCount ) { oldGeneration . slice ( 0 , longLiversCount ) . forEach ( ( longLivingGenome : Genome ) => { newGeneration . push ( longLivingGenome ) ; } ) ; } const fitnessPerOldGenome : number [ ] = oldGeneration . map ( ( genome : Genome ) => fitness ( genome ) ) ; while ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { let father : Genome | null = null ; let fatherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; let mother : Genome | null = null ; let matherGenomeIndex : number | null = null ; while ( ! father || ! mother || fatherGenomeIndex === matherGenomeIndex ) { const { item : randomFather , index : randomFatherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; const { item : randomMother , index : randomMotherGenomeIndex , } = weightedRandom < Genome > ( generation , fitnessPerOldGenome ) ; father = randomFather ; fatherGenomeIndex = randomFatherGenomeIndex ; mother = randomMother ; matherGenomeIndex = randomMotherGenomeIndex ; } const [ firstChild , secondChild ] = mate ( father , mother , mutationProbability ) ; newGeneration . push ( firstChild ) ; if ( newGeneration . length < generation . length ) { newGeneration . push ( secondChild ) ; } } return newGeneration ; }

Fitness function

The fitness of the car will be defined by the distance from the car to the parking spot. The higher the distance, the lower the fitness.

The final distance we will calculate is an average distance from 4 car wheels to the correspondent 4 corners of the parking spot. This distance we will call the loss which is inversely proportional to the fitness .

Calculating the distance between each wheel and each corner separately (instead of just calculating the distance from the car center to the parking spot center) will make the car preserve the proper orientation relative to the parking spot.

The distance between two points in space will be calculated based on the Pythagorean theorem like this:

type NumVec3 = [ number , number , number ] ; const euclideanDistance = ( from : NumVec3 , to : NumVec3 ) => { const fromX = from [ 0 ] ; const fromZ = from [ 2 ] ; const toX = to [ 0 ] ; const toZ = to [ 2 ] ; return Math . sqrt ( ( fromX - toX ) ** 2 + ( fromZ - toZ ) ** 2 ) ; } ;

The distance (the loss ) between the car and the parking spot will be calculated like this:

type RectanglePoints = { fl : NumVec3 , fr : NumVec3 , bl : NumVec3 , br : NumVec3 , } ; type GeometricParams = { wheelsPosition : RectanglePoints , parkingLotCorners : RectanglePoints , } ; const carLoss = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const { wheelsPosition , parkingLotCorners } = params ; const { fl : flWheel , fr : frWheel , br : brWheel , bl : blWheel , } = wheelsPosition ; const { fl : flCorner , fr : frCorner , br : brCorner , bl : blCorner , } = parkingLotCorners ; const flDistance = euclideanDistance ( flWheel , flCorner ) ; const frDistance = euclideanDistance ( frWheel , frCorner ) ; const brDistance = euclideanDistance ( brWheel , brCorner ) ; const blDistance = euclideanDistance ( blWheel , blCorner ) ; return ( flDistance + frDistance + brDistance + blDistance ) / 4 ; } ;

Since the fitness should be inversely proportional to the loss we'll calculate it like this:

const carFitness = ( params : GeometricParams ) : number => { const loss = carLoss ( params ) ; return 1 / ( loss + 1 ) ; } ;

You may see the fitness and the loss values for a specific genome and for a current car position on the Evolution Simulator dashboard:

Launching the evolution

Let's put the evolution functions together. We're going to ""create the world"", launch the evolution loop, make the time going, the generation evolving, and the cars learning how to park.

To get the fitness values of each car we need to run a simulation of the cars behavior in a virtual 3D world. The Evolution Simulator does exactly that - it runs the code below in the simulator, which is made with Three.js:

const GENERATION_SIZE = 1000 ; const LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE = 6 ; const MUTATION_PROBABILITY = 0.04 ; const MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM = 40 ; const carFitnessFunction = ( genome : Genome ) : number => { const genomeKey = genome . join ( '' ) ; return fitnessValues [ genomeKey ] ; } ; let generationIndex = 0 ; let generation : Generation = createGeneration ( { generationSize : GENERATION_SIZE , genomeLength : GENOME_LENGTH , } ) ; while ( generationIndex < MAX_GENERATIONS_NUM ) { generation = select ( generation , carFitnessFunction , { mutationProbability : MUTATION_PROBABILITY , longLivingChampionsPercentage : LONG_LIVING_CHAMPIONS_PERCENTAGE , } , ) ; generationIndex += 1 ; } const fittestCar = generation [ 0 ] ;

After running the select() function, the generation array is sorted by the fitness values in descending order. Therefore, the fittest car will always be the first car in the array.

The 1st generation of cars with random genomes will behave something like this:

On the ≈40th generation the cars start learning what the self-parking is and start getting closer to the parking spot:

Another example with a bit more challenging starting point:

The cars are hitting some other cars along the way, and also are not perfectly fitting the parking spot, but this is only the 40th generation since the creation of the world for them, so you may give the cars some more time to learn.

From generation to generation we may see how the loss values are going down (which means that fitness values are going up). The P50 Avg Loss shows the average loss value (average distance from the cars to the parking spot) of the 50% of fittest cars. The Min Loss shows the loss value of the fittest car in each generation.

You may see that on average the 50% of the fittest cars of the generation are learning to get closer to the parking spot (from 5.5m away from the parking spot to 3.5m in 35 generations). The trend for the Min Loss values is less obvious (from 1m to 0.5m with some noise signals), however from the animations above you may see that cars have learned some basic parking moves.

Conclusion

In this article, we've broken down the high-level task of creating the self-parking car to the straightforward low-level task of finding the optimal combination of 180 ones and zeroes (finding the optimal car genome).

Then we've applied the genetic algorithm to find the optimal car genome. It allowed us to get pretty good results in several hours of simulation (instead of many years of running the naive approach).

You may launch the 🚕 Self-parking Car Evolution Simulator to see the evolution process directly in your browser. The simulator gives you the following opportunities:

The full genetic source code that was shown in this article may also be found in the Evolution Simulator repository. If you are one of those folks who will actually count and check the number of lines to make sure there are less than 500 of them (excluding tests), please feel free to check the code here 🥸.

There are still some unresolved issues with the code and the simulator:

The car's brain is oversimplified and it uses linear equations instead of, let's say, neural networks. It makes the car not adaptable to the new surroundings or to the new parking lot types.

We don't decrease the car's fitness value when the car is hitting the other car. Therefore the car doesn't ""feel"" any guilt in creating the road accident.

The evolution simulator is not stable. It means that the same car genome may produce different fitness values, which makes the evolution less efficient.

The evolution simulator is also very heavy in terms of performance, which slows down the evolution progress since we can't train, let's say, 1000 cars at once.

Also the Evolution Simulator requires the browser tab to be open and active to perform the simulation.

and more...

However, the purpose of this article was to have some fun while learning how the genetic algorithm works and not to build a production-ready self-parking Teslas.

288,Threatened Swedish artist reportedly dead in road accident,"STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

The accident reportedly involved a truck colliding with a civilian police car in which Lars Vilks and his police protection were traveling, news media said.

The Swedish news agency TT said police had confirmed that Vilks, 75, was traveling in the car with two police officers, and the newspaper Dagens Nyheter said the artist’s partner confirmed his death.

The cause of the accident was under investigation.

Vilks was largely unknown outside Sweden before his Muhammad drawing. At home, he was best known for building a sculpture made of driftwood in a nature reserve in southern Sweden without permission, triggering a lengthy legal battle. He was fined, but the seaside sculpture — a jumble of wood nailed together in chaotic fashion — draws tens of thousands of visitors a year.

Vilks’ life changed radically 13 years ago after he drew a sketch of Muhammad with a dog’s body. Dogs are considered unclean by conservative Muslims, and Islamic law generally opposes any depiction of the prophet, even favorable, for fear it could lead to idolatry.

Al-Qaida put a bounty on Vilks’ head. In 2010, two men tried to burn down his house in southern Sweden. Last year, a woman from Pennsylvania pleaded guilty in a plot to try to kill him.","['traveling', 'sculpture', 'artist', 'dogs', 'road', 'reportedly', 'sweden', 'threatened', 'vilks', 'muhammad', 'southern', 'sketch', 'dead', 'swedish', 'accident']","STOCKHOLM (AP) — The Swedish artist Lars Vilks, who had lived under police protection since his 2007 sketch of the Prophet Muhammad with a dog’s body brought death threats, died from a traffic accident Sunday, Swedish news media reported.

291,"Rajasthan RTI Activist Dies, Family Claims He Was Killed By People He Exposed","The body was handed over to the family members after postmortem on Sunday (Representationa;)

The family of RTI activist Rai Singh Gurjar, who died in a road accident last week, has alleged foul play, claiming he was killed by people he had exposed in graft cases over the last five years.

Police have registered a case of murder against four to five people on the basis of a complaint lodged by Gurjar's family and began a probe.

However, they said it appeared to be a case of accident and the exact cause will be known after receiving the postmortem report.

The deputy sarpanch of Titarwasa gram panchayat in Jhalawar district suffered a critical head injury in a road accident late Saturday night and died during treatment.

In September 2019, the 27-year-old RTI activist had raised his voice against corruption in developmental work being carried out in Titarwasa gram panchayat, which was adopted by Vice President Venkaiah Naidu under the MP model village scheme in May 2017.

Later also, he continued to speak against corrupt practices by local officials and public representatives.

On Saturday night, Rai Gurjar suffered a critical head injury after his motorbike was hit by an auto rickshaw in Madhopura village. He was rushed to Jhalawar district hospital, where he succumbed to injuries during treatment later in the night.

""There was no mark of injury or scratch all over the body but a deep wound into his head and no mark of accident all over the place, where the accident reportedly occurred on Saturday night,"" Sujan Singh Gurjar, brother of the RTI activist said.

""The deep wound into his head apparently appeared to have been lashed with some sharp weapon,"" he said, alleging his brother was attacked with a sharp weapon and was murdered as he had been pursuing to expose corruption at various levels in different government projects being carried out in the area.

The murder was projected as a road accident, Sujan Gurjar claimed, adding that he lodged a complaint with the police on Sunday against Titarwasa gram sevak Chandra Singh, village sarpanch Kalulal Bheel, who is an accused in a graft case, Dinesh Patidar, who is involved in illegal transportation of soil, and Naipal Singh, a resident of Titarwas village.

An FIR was registered under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC against four to five persons, SHO at Jhalrapatan police station Jitendra Singh Shekhawat said.

The body was handed over to the family members after postmortem on Sunday and the exact cause of death would be clear only after receiving the postmortem report, the SHO said.

Mr Shekhawat, however, said it appeared to be a case of accident.

293,"Chhattisgarh Judge Steps Out Of Courtroom, Awards Rs 20 Lakh Aid To Paralysed Man","The accident victim was unable to go to the courtroom due to his medical condition. (Representational)

A district court judge in Chhattisgarh's Korba stepped out of the four walls of a courtroom to award Rs 20 lakh compensation to a 42-year-old man, who had suffered paralysis after sustaining multiple injuries in a road accident in 2018.

The accident victim, Dwarika Prasad Kanwar, was unable to go to the courtroom due to his medical condition.

District and Sessions court judge BP Verma, who is also the chairman of the District Legal Services Authority, was hearing Kanwar's accident compensation case during the National Lok Adalat on Saturday.

When he came to know about the medical condition of Mr Kanwar, the judge came out of the courtroom and went to the parking area of the court complex, where the victim was waiting in a vehicle, a government public relations officer said in a statement on Sunday.

Mr Kanwar's lawyer PS Rajput and respondent insurance company's advocate Ramnarayan Rathore accompanied the judge to the parking area, where he delivered the judgment. The judge ordered the insurance company to give a compensation of Rs 20 lakh to the victim, the official said.

Mr Kanwar had suffered multiple injuries after his car collided with a trailer in December 2018 at Manikpur area of Raigarh town in the district. He had suffered multiple injuries, including a fracture in the spinal cord, in the accident. After that he had also suffered paralysis.
