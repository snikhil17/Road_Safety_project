Addressing the 'Karmayogis' of Border Road Organisation (BRO) via video conferencing, the Union Defence Minister said, ""Accidents on the roads are a cause of great concern for us today. It is a matter of great surprise that our country has less than 3 per cent of the world's total vehicles, but accidents are close to 11 per cent. Every year around 4.5-5 lakh accidents and 1.5 lakh unfortunate deaths occur in the country. It is not less than a silent pandemic.""

""To get rid of all this, whatever steps the government has taken, such as approving the 'National Road Safety Policy', bringing in the 'Motor Vehicle Act 2020', identifying black spots on national highways...these centres also have their own importance,"" he said. BRO on Friday launched four new software for works management, road infrastructure digitisation, human resource management and recruitment management.

""The four software being launched today will bring efficiency to the work of the organization and will also save their time. Their creation also marks the success of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' and 'Digital India' campaigns,"" stated Singh. The Union Defence Minister said the start of two 'Centres of Excellence' based on the study of 'Road Safety', and roads, bridges, tunnels, air-fields is a matter of great pride for the country. He said these centres complement each other in their objectives.

""Right from its inception, BRO has been playing a vital role in the progress of the nation by building roads, tunnels and other infrastructure in remote areas. The most important component is connectivity. For connectivity, our BRO personnel have been working tirelessly even in the midst of difficulties like severe winter, heat, rain, snowfall. In the last 5-7 years, BRO has made even more remarkable achievements,"" he said. He emphasised the increase in the budget of BRO by three to four times during the last five to seven years is not a trivial matter. Apart from this, 3,270 sets of special high altitude clothing are approved for our engineers and other personnel.

The Union Defence Minister further mentioned the slogans like ""Sawdhani hati durghatna ghati"" also helps making people aware while on road. Singh further extended his best wishes to woman biker Kanchan for her solo expedition.

""I feel good knowing about Kanchan ji who is going to start solo women motorcycle expedition today. I was told that at an early age she started riding a motorcycle. So far she has covered 21,000 km in 10 years. I wish her all the best for this expedition,"" he said. (ANI)

The mishap occurred in the C4 compartment of the train, and so far no injuries have been reported and all passengers were evacuated safely.

Amid the accident, here is a look at the top ten deadly train disasters in India:

1. 1981 Bihar Train Disaster:

Near Saharsa, Bihar, a passenger train estimated to be carrying around 900 people derailed and sank into the Baghmati River. Total deaths are estimated to be over 500 people. Dubbed one of the worst train accidents in India, some claim the accident was caused by a cyclone, while others claim it was caused by flash flooding.

2. 1995 Firozabad Rail Disaster:

A stationary Kalindi Express near Firozabad, Uttar Pradesh, was rammed by a Delhi-bound Purushottam Express, killing at least 358 people. After hitting a cow, the Kalindi Express became stuck on the tracks due to a brake failure. Since Purushottam Express was allowed to operate on the same track at the same time, the tragedy occurred.

3. 1999 Gaisal Train Disaster

At least 290 people were killed when two trains carrying over 2,500 passengers collided near Gaisal, Assam, about 310 miles from Guwahati. The trains collided at such a high rate that they exploded, killing a large number of people.

4. 1998 Khanna Train Disaster

The Jammu Tawi-Sealdah Express bound for Kolkata collided with six derailed Frontier Golden Temple Mail coaches bound for Amritsar near Khanna on the Khanna-Ludhiana section of India’s Northern Railway in Punjab, killing at least 212 people.

5. 2010 Gyaneshwari Express Disaster

At least 170 people were killed in a suspected Maoist attack when the Mumbai-bound Howrah Kurla Lokmanya Tilak Gyaneshwari Super Deluxe Express was derailed by an explosion (or sabotage) between Khemashuli and Sardiha in West Midnapore district at 1:30 a.m., and then hit by a goods train.

6. 2016 Indore Patna Disaster

The Indore–Patna Express 19321, a scheduled train from Indore to Patna, derailed near Pukhrayan, Kanpur, India, on November 20, 2016, killing at least 150 people and injuring more than 150 others.

7. 2002 Howrah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express

Over 140 people were killed when the Howrah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express derailed near Rafiganj station between Gaya and Dehri-on-Sone stations at 10:40 p.m. Since the same track was deemed fragile and was from the British period, the rail incident was triggered by a manual fault. Heavy rain triggered a track break, which contributed to the derailment of the Rajdhani, which was moving at 100 km/h.

8. 2005 Valigonda Train Tragedy

A flash flood washed away a small rail bridge on October 29, 2005, and a “Delta Fast Passenger"" train traveling on it derailed at the damaged section of the line, killing at least 114 people and injuring over 200 others.

9. 2010 Sainthia Train Crash

The Uttar Banga Express collided with the Vananchal Express in Sainthia, West Bengal, on July 19, 2010. About 63 people killed and over 165 people wounded.

10. 2012 Hampi Express Accident

The Hubli-Bangalore Hampi Express collided with a goods train near Andhra Pradesh on May 22, 2012. The train’s four bogies derailed, and one of them caught fire, killing about 25 passengers and charring several others, while injuring about 43 others.

I don't know how much y'all know about weddings over there, but this was a 3 day event that involved the entirety of two middle-of-nowhere-nothing villages...it was a huge deal. And we were the only white people the majority of these folks had ever seen, so beyond the bride and groom themselves, we were The Best Guests."", ""This meant near constant attention, no relaxation or any time to ourselves, and 'sleep' came in the form of a concrete slab of a bed with a thin blanket over it, nestled snuggly in between apparently every drunk uncle the village could hold, all passionately arguing for hours about SOMETHING in Hindi. I think it was maybe the music, which also constantly blared from concert-sized speakers through the whole village. It was safe to say by the time we left the wedding we were already extremely sleep deprived and out of it. This isn't even the fun part though."", ""Through an odd chain of events that isn't totally related to this story, while driving home on the single-lane road that had traffic in both directions, dodging donkey carts, groups of scooters, and other drivers at about 120kph (72mph for us Freedom Unit-ers out there), we get in a head-on collision."", 'I remember realizing what was going to happen a few seconds before it did. Closing my eyes, loosening my body, making sure my tongue would be ok and then-BAM. The world turned upside down. And then again. And again.

I remember being extremely confused and dazed. And I hurt. Why did I hurt?', ""Dozens of people had apparently stopped to flip the car back over to help The American Tourists out. A few people pulled me out through the left-hand broken window and immediately went back in to help my father on the driver's side. I, extremely confused, exhausted, and scared, most likely concussed (I later found out definitely concussed), wandered over to the road and the other demolished car. I could hear a siren in the distance. An ambulance? Cops? I didn't pay attention. Where were my shoes?"", 'Suddenly a man had his arms around my shoulders and was ushering me to an unknown white car a small distance from the wreck. ""I will take you to the hospital"" he said. I asked where my father was and a few other questions. He mostly ignored me.', '""He is fine, come on""', 'He pushed me forward, and in a daze I followed, asking about my things, my shoes, my dad.

Road accidents are the leading cause of death among people in the 5-29 age-group worldwide according to a World Health Organisation report.

More than 1.35 million lives are lost each year and 50 million people sustain injuries. Globally, road accidents are the tenth leading cause of death.

India accounts for about 5 lakh road accidents annually, one of the highest in the world, in which about 1.5 lakh people die and another 3 lakh become crippled.

Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways V.K. Singh has said that around 71% of 4.49 lakh road accidents in India in 2019 were due to over speeding.

According to experts, the main causes of road accidents in India are rapid urbanisation, poor safety, lack of enforcement, distracted drivers, influence of drugs or alcohol, speeding and a failure to wear seat-belts or helmets.

There has been a 10% reduction in the number of deaths caused due to accidents in the country since the passage of the amended Motor Vehicles Act, said Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.

He said the government has pledged to reduce 50% accidents in the next five years, and India is a signatory to this at the World Safety Conference held in Sweden recently.

Among various steps being taken to reduce accidents, the government proposes to open 1,000 driving schools in the country.

In 2020, the government launched a central accident database management system known as the Integrated Road Accident Database that will help in analysing causes of road crashes and in devising safety interventions to reduce such accidents in the country.","A video explainer on India's battle with road accidents in numbersRoad accidents are the leading cause of death among people in the 5-29 age-group worldwide according to a World Health Organisation report.

Mumbai: A shocking revelation: At least 25 teenagers are killed in road accidents every day -- or an average of one each hour -- in India, coming to a whopping total of around 9,400 annually, a non-profit organization (NGO) said here on Friday.

Citing the stunning figures for 2017, the NGO Synergie, said the majority of these accidents involved two-wheelers like scooters, motorcycles or mopeds and largely due to helmetless driving or pillion riding by the youngsters.

The reason is youngsters, mostly teenagers, tend to over speed, indulge in rash driving and drive without helmets.

As per the 2017 data, the total injuries due to helmetless driving were 35,975 and 36,687 deaths for all categories of two-wheeler driving.

The revelations came at a workshop, which included Synergie, Global Road Safety Partnership, hosted by International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, attended by around two dozen school and college principals and others.

Expressing concerns over the large number of juvenile deaths due to helmetless driving, including pillion riding, experts said it was aggravated by the dark world of motorbike stunts and illegal street races.

""Education, awareness, and enforcement is the answer to ensure that kids and adults wear helmets while driving on the roads,"" urged Maharashtra's Joint Transport Commissioner Jitendra Patil.

""If a kid is injured or something worse happens, it affects the entire family... Imagine the scenario in the age of 'nuclear' families with a single child,"" pointed out Synergie's Founder Indrani Maitra, who considers it a psychological issue.

State President of Shikshak Bharti Subhash More said education is the key to address these issues, the importance of using helmets for safe driving from a young age and this must reach to each and every school in the country.

Drawing on his own experiences in such cases, Traffic Police Inspector (Education) S. Paradkar said that ""road accidents involving children are very difficult to handle... the sad scene, the condition of the parents... difficult to describe in words"".

In this regard, he mentioned that the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill has been passed by the union cabinet on June 24, which drastically hikes penalties and fines for traffic violations.

Under the proposed new laws covering various aspects of road safety, helmetless driving would attract a fine of Rs1,000 besides suspension of the offender's driving license for three months.","Majority of the accidents 'involved two-wheelers and largely due to helmetless driving'Mumbai: A shocking revelation: At least 25 teenagers are killed in road accidents every day -- or an average of one each hour -- in India, coming to a whopping total of around 9,400 annually, a non-profit organization (NGO) said here on Friday.
Citing the stunning figures for 2017, the NGO Synergie, said the majority of these accidents involved two-wheelers like scooters, motorcycles or mopeds and largely due to helmetless driving or pillion riding by the youngsters.
As per the 2017 data, the total injuries due to helmetless driving were 35,975 and 36,687 deaths for all categories of two-wheeler driving.
Expressing concerns over the large number of juvenile deaths due to helmetless driving, including pillion riding, experts said it was aggravated by the dark world of motorbike stunts and illegal street races.

CAG report on Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), tabled in Parliament on Wednesday, has raised concern about the weak regulatory framework in the country that could pose potential danger like Chernobyl or the recent accident in Fukushima, Japan.Worse, the AERB, which supervises safety issues of 22 running nuclear plants across the country, has no rule-making powers nor does it have authority of enforcement and levy of penalties in the context of nuclear safety oversight.“The maximum amount of fine (Rs 500) was too low to serve as a deterrent against such infringements,” the CAG said after a detailed audit of the regulator which is responsible for review of safety aspects of nuclear power plants and of all radiation facilities across the country.While this sounds grim, in reality, two recent pieces of legislation are intended to resolve precisely these lacunae. The Nuclear Liability Act passed by Parliament in May 2010 makes the operator liable to pay “no-fault” compensation of up to Rs 1,500 crore, beyond which India can access the Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC) for additional liability.The second piece of legislation is the Atomic Energy Regulatory Authority , which has just been cleared by the Union Cabinet and will subsume the AERB. It is intended to establish an autonomous nuclear energy regulator, which will not function under the Department of Atomic Energy as the case is at present.The government’s official auditor blamed the central government for not learning any lessons from the Fukushima disaster as failure to have an autonomous and empowered regulator is fraught with grave risks. The CAG backed its assertion quoting a recent independent investigation report on the Fukushima accident which confirmed that weak regulatory mechanism and oversight by regulators were the chief reasons behind the disaster.The performance audit of AERB was undertaken in the context of the criticality of issues relating to radiation risks and the effectiveness of the nuclear regulator in the exercise of its role. “At the policy level, AERB has not yet prepared a radiation safety policy even after three decades of its existence.

Eleven coaches of the Seemanchal Express derailed near Sahadai Buzurg railway station, about 50km from the state capital Patna, early on Sunday morning.

Most of the travellers were asleep when the train, travelling at 55 kilometres per hour, derailed at around 4am local time (22:30GMT on Saturday).

“I was sleeping and suddenly there was a big bang and I found myself under a pile of bags,” passenger Mahesh Kumar told AFP news agency.

According to a statement released by Indian Railways, a “rail fracture” caused the accident.

Local media reported that cash compensation of 500,000 rupees (almost $7,000) would be paid to the relatives of those killed, local media reported.

Minister of Railways of India Piyush Goyal recently claimed to have improved rail safety after a series of deadly accidents in the country.

“Over the last four and a half years, we have inculcated a new culture of implementing transformative reforms […] As a result, the past year has emerged as a year of ‘many firsts’ for Indian Railways,” Goyal told local media last year.

India‘s state railways, largely built during colonial rule, is the main form of long-distance transportation for its 23 million passengers.

The government has pledged $137bn over five years to modernise the crumbling network.

But decades of underinvestment in rail safety infrastructure have led to numerous disasters.

A 2012 government report said 15,000 people are killed in rail-related accidents every year.

In November 2016, the Patna-Indore express derailed in Uttar Pradesh state, killing 139 people.

Last April, 13 children were killed when a train hit a school bus in the same state.

At least 59 people were killed in October 2018 when a commuter train travelling at a high speed travelled through a crowd of people on the rail tracks in northern India while they were attending a religious festival.

It was the deadliest accident of the year, bringing the number of victims of train accidents to 72 in 2018.","Several others injured when the Delhi-bound train derailed in the early hours of Sunday.

Ignorance, negligence, carelessness and dereliction of duty besides equipment failure have led to incidents and they must be checked. We should learn from mistakes of the past and should not repeat them”

According to a story in the Times of India, as far back as 2014, there were plans in place to create an independent entity to monitor safety issues. The Times story reported that the Oil Ministry was ready for approval from the Cabinet on the creation of a petroleum and natural gas safety board, but there was never any movement on the issue. The matter was not considered under the following government. The Times notes that the issue of gas pricing dominated any energy discussions.

The Times also reported that there were eight different entities pertaining to safety in the oil and gas industry, and that those agencies were created under different laws. Furthermore, they were not connected to one another. The Oil Industry Safety Directorate was tasked with monitoring safety in the industry, but had no real legal power to impose sanctions for violations.

At the Jaipur conference, S Kamal the Chief Controller of the Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organization, or Peso, said that his group has “introduced auto-renewal of licenses of petrol pump, petroleum transportation, LPG godowns and filling plants and the facility will be offered for other premises as well in next three months.”

He stated: ""It is the first of its kind initiative which will save time of the stakeholders and PESO as well.""

In a yet another rail accident in India within 10 days, about nine coaches and the engine of a passenger train derailed near western state of Maharashtra’s Thane district on Tuesday (29 August) morning.

There are no immediate reports of casualties or injuries, but it is the third such major train mishap this month on the world’s fourth biggest rail network.

The nine carriages of the Duronto Express plying between Mumbai and the central Indian city of Nagpur derailed near Asangaon in Thane district, about 70km (44 miles) outside the Indian financial capital, at around 6.40am local time (1.10am BST).

Local media reports say the rescue and relief teams are at the accident spot.

“There are no injuries to passengers. We are arranging buses to bring passengers to destination. Doctors and senior officers are already at site,” Central Railway said in a statement.

Footage shared on social media showed passengers getting off the train themselves.

Electricity supply to the train was reported to have been shut off as precautionary measure to prevent any loss of lives.

Death toll from train derailments in India in 2016-17 is reported to be highest in a decade. At least 193 people have died in these accidents as of March.

POLL

The increase in the casualties is believed to be despite a significant dip in train mishaps in the last 10 years in the country.

Reports suggest train derailments are the primary cause for major accidents in India – 78 of the 104 accidents were because of carriages going off tracks, Indian broadcaster CNN News18 reported.

On 23 August, at least 42 people were injured after 11 coaches of the Kaifiyat Express, travelling to the Indian capital, New Delhi, went off the tracks after it collided with a truck loaded with construction material.

In another major incident a week earlier, 23 people were killed and 123 injured in a derailment near the Hindu holy city of Haridwar in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. As many as 13 carriages of the Puri-Haridwar Utkal Express came off the tracks on 19 August near the town of Khatauli.

The incidents prompted India’s Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu to offer his resignation, while the Narendra Modi government suspended three senior railway officials.","Another Rail Accident in India As 9 Coaches Of Train Derail Outside MumbaiIn a yet another rail accident in India within 10 days, about nine coaches and the engine of a passenger train derailed near western state of Maharashtra’s Thane district on Tuesday (29 August) morning.

NEW DELHI (AP) — When an under-construction overpass collapsed and killed at least 23 people in the bustling east Indian city of Kolkata, the images were shocking: massive fallen steel girders, taxis crumpled under slabs of concrete, a crushed truck, destroyed rickshaws and dozens of people trapped.

What followed was more or less routine in this country of 1.3 billion.

The chief minister of West Bengal state blamed the private builders and the previous government that had commissioned the project. Other officials shot back by accusing her of playing politics. And the builders expressed surprise, calling the accident ""an act of God.""

The overpass spanned nearly the width of the street and was designed to ease traffic through the densely crowded Bara Bazaar neighborhood in the capital of the east Indian state of West Bengal. About 100 meters (300 feet) of the overpass fell, while other sections remained standing. (AP Photo/Bikas Das)

Tragic accidents from failing infrastructure, some of it old and some just being built, have occurred regularly as India undergoes a breakneck construction boom. Many projects are mired in messy delays and allegations of corruption. Others are marred by poor quality materials, inadequate supervision, poor safety standards for workers or the outright flouting of building codes.

Construction of the Vivekanand overpass in the northern part of the state capital of Kolkata was expected to be finished in two years when the contract was signed in 2007 with Hyderabad-based IVRCL Infrastructure. But no one was surprised when the company overshot both its budget and several deadlines.

Here are some other major construction accidents in India in recent years.

- April 2013: At least 74 people were killed when an under-construction building collapsed in Thane, a western Indian suburb of Mumbai.

- November 2010: A poorly built residential building toppled in a crowded part of the Indian capital, killing 65 people.

- September 2010: Shortly before India was to host the Commonwealth Games, a suspension bridge outside a stadium crashed onto the road beneath it, injuring 27 workers. The accident became a symbol of the chaos that surrounds India's preparations for the sporting event.

- July 2009: Five workers were crushed to death and 13 others were injured when a section of a bridge being built to carry Delhi's metro trains collapses in a residential neighborhood.","Overpass collapse just latest construction accident in IndiaNEW DELHI (AP) — When an under-construction overpass collapsed and killed at least 23 people in the bustling east Indian city of Kolkata, the images were shocking: massive fallen steel girders, taxis crumpled under slabs of concrete, a crushed truck, destroyed rickshaws and dozens of people trapped.

Its India's worst kept secret - we have the world's most unsafe roads and the situation seems to be getting worse by the year. Over 400 people were killed in road accidents every day in 2015, government data reveals.Fresh data submitted by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in the Rajya Sabha this week indicates just how alarming the situation is. 1,46,133 people were killed in road accidents in India in 2015, a 4.6% rise over 2014 when 1,39,671 people were killed.In the past one decade, over 1.3 million people have been killed in road accidents but there is still no comprehensive road safety legislation in the country. According to the 234th report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture which has recently been tabled in Parliament, there are several stumbling blocks for replacing the existing Motor Vehicles Act with a proposed Road Transport and Safety Bill, 2015.According to the report, the Ministry ""wanted to change the entire architecture over road transport and road safety in the whole country, basically, setting up a set of authorities at the Central level and the State level to control all aspects of transport and public transport including driving licences.""However, this has not been possible because ""the main hitch is on sharing of revenues between the Centre and the state"" in implementing the changes which have been proposed. In an effort to still try and push the safety measures through, the government claims it is trying to focus on noncontroversial, achievable goals such as ""an increase in the penalty for drunken driving or increasing the penalty for unauthorized driving, minor driving.""While it is well established that our roads and highways are deadly to travel on, according to the data, the states with the highest number of road accidents in 2015 are Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala.

After …","A few days back a young man from Kurukshetra, Dikshant Sharma had started a petition requesting Aamir Khan to take up the issue of Road Accidents in India on his show Satyamev Jayate.

After I signed the petition [i], I surfed for information on road traffic accidents and came to know the following facts:

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), road traffic accidents are the leading cause of death for young people in developing countries. India accounts for about 10% of road crash fatalities worldwide.

One person dies every five minutes on Indian roads. Going by National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), this figure is expected to escalate to one death every three minutes by 2020 [ii]. In terms of absolute numbers more people die in road crashes in India than anywhere else in the world.

Every other day we read in the newspapers about road accidents. Unresponsive governance coupled with personal apathy makes the situation worse and many are left to die on the streets even when hospitals are close by.

The disconcerting question is why do these recurring incidents of traffic death remain as just statistics and do not stir up the authorities or people in general?

This problem of personal apathy & unresponsive governance can partly be explained by the fact that people tend to fear and react more to situations in which many people may be killed at one point in time as opposed to situations in which number of casualty remains the same or might be even more, but the deaths are distributed over a longer period of time.

These low-probability high-consequence events such as the terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008 or the disappearance of MH370 are known as ‘Dread Risks‘. Since dread risk events are perceived as unknown and potentially catastrophic, such events evoke widespread fear, anxiety and sharp psychological reactions that may produce large ripple effects.

An article published in Psychological Science, on behalf of the American Psychological Society corroborates the concept of Dread Risk. The study suggests that the fear of flying following September 11, 2001 caused more people in America to travel by road, resulting in 353 additional highway deaths than would have otherwise been the case [iii]. As the dread risk events have enormous impact simultaneously on a large group of people, these are highly publicized and governments all around the world, focus on responding to events quickly to control & contain the situation and rightly so.

On the other hand, in case of road accidents, though the families of victims suffer immense psychosocial distress, the psychological impact on general public is not so pronounced. Despite the appalling dimensions of the problem, road safety ranks very low on our list of priorities. The cultural indifference ambivalence towards road traffic deaths, does not compel the government to change the status quo. More people die in road crashes than due to malaria or TB, yet the government hardly notices.

This emphasizes the necessity for creating awareness about the need for pre-hospital emergency medical response for accident victims. We need a shift in focus from inevitability of the accidents to preventability of accidents and injury control.

This is not to say that public awareness initiatives will be sufficient to prevent the road tragedies; it will require the concerted effort from government including parliament, the police, road users, NGOs and the media to develop & implement policies on injury prevention. Scientifically designed roads, automobile design safety, better law enforcement and road user sensitization are needed to bring down RTAs.

However to begin with, if the public were better informed about the plight of accident victims, and how to provide them immediate access to medics, it will also possibly help in creating demand for emergency response for accident victims, thus saving thousands of lives.

A passenger train has crashed into a school bus in southern India, killing at least 11 children, with fears the death toll could rise further, officials say.

A senior police officer said “11 students and the bus driver were killed”, while a railway official said he feared as many as 25 children were dead after Thursday’s collision in newly formed Telangana state.

Ravi Nallamala, a local police officer, said at least 16 children aged 7 to 14 had been injured and hospitalised in Medak district.

The area is nearly 1,500km south of New Delhi.

K Samba Siva Rao, a spokesman for South Central Railway, said the train hit the bus at an unmanned railway crossing in the village of Masaipet, about 62km from Hyderabad in Telangana, which this year was carved out of Andhra Pradesh state.

The bus was dragged several hundred metres down the tracks, according to local media reports.

The train was travelling from the city of Nanded in Maharashtra state to Hyderabad. No one on the train was killed, officials said.

“So far 11 children and one school bus driver died. Sixteen children are injured and have been shifted to hospitals,” N Suryanaarayana, local police deputy inspector general, said.

“The cause of the accident and whose mistake it is we are investigating.”

Rao said the school bus was carrying up to 38 children from the Kakatiya Techno School in the town of Toopran.

“As per present information about 25 schoolchildren seem to have been killed,” he told AFP.

“Around 38 were in the bus as far as we know, and the rest are being sent to the hospital.”

Accidents are common on India’s railroad network, one of the world’s largest with 20 million people riding daily on about 11,000 passenger trains.

In 2012 a government report said almost 15,000 people were killed every year on the network, describing the deaths as an annual “massacre” due mainly to poor safety standards.

Most accidents are blamed on poor maintenance and human error.","Police say 11 children dead after train crashes into school bus at unmanned railway crossing in Telangana state.

CAG report on Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB), tabled in Parliament on Wednesday, has raised concern about the weak regulatory framework in the country that could pose potential danger like Chernobyl or the recent accident in Fukushima, Japan.Worse, the AERB, which supervises safety issues of 22 running nuclear plants across the country, has no rule-making powers nor does it have authority of enforcement and levy of penalties in the context of nuclear safety oversight.“The maximum amount of fine (Rs 500) was too low to serve as a deterrent against such infringements,” the CAG said after a detailed audit of the regulator which is responsible for review of safety aspects of nuclear power plants and of all radiation facilities across the country.While this sounds grim, in reality, two recent pieces of legislation are intended to resolve precisely these lacunae. The Nuclear Liability Act passed by Parliament in May 2010 makes the operator liable to pay “no-fault” compensation of up to Rs 1,500 crore, beyond which India can access the Convention on Supplementary Compensation (CSC) for additional liability.The second piece of legislation is the Atomic Energy Regulatory Authority , which has just been cleared by the Union Cabinet and will subsume the AERB. It is intended to establish an autonomous nuclear energy regulator, which will not function under the Department of Atomic Energy as the case is at present.The government’s official auditor blamed the central government for not learning any lessons from the Fukushima disaster as failure to have an autonomous and empowered regulator is fraught with grave risks. The CAG backed its assertion quoting a recent independent investigation report on the Fukushima accident which confirmed that weak regulatory mechanism and oversight by regulators were the chief reasons behind the disaster.The performance audit of AERB was undertaken in the context of the criticality of issues relating to radiation risks and the effectiveness of the nuclear regulator in the exercise of its role. “At the policy level, AERB has not yet prepared a radiation safety policy even after three decades of its existence. Standard setting is an essential part of the functions of a regulatory authority,” the report said.","NEW DELHI: In case of a nuclear accident in India at present, the maximum fine that can be imposed by the regulator on an offending nuclear plant is Rs 500.

It would not make sense for the rescue party to cut it into 2 and then move the engine/front part about 10meters behind the car in the opposite direction.

Plus my guess is that if they were to cut the car to rescue the people they would cut the A-pillars and ""peel"" the roof off, rather than trying to cut through solid metal like that!!!

After divorce : Well, No Rights. Get ready to share your half of the assets and properties with your wife as per respective religious laws. Even if your wife is working, Section 125 of CRPC requires a wife to live at the same standards which she maintained during her marriage with the husband. So you might end up paying maintenance.

A person is entitled to maintenance under Section 125 despite having obtained an order under the applicable personal law.', 'Quantum of maintenance Maintenance covers not merely food, clothing and shelter, but also includes other necessities. The quantum and type of necessities covered within the scope of maintenance may vary, depending on the status, financial position and number of dependents, etc and is at the discretion of the court. Prior to passing an order under Section 125, the court does take cognizance of the amount of maintenance already ordered under the personal law. The reasoning is based on the premise that the wife is entitled to live as per the standard and status of her husband. Males can\'t adopt female children but females can adopt male children. Other rights like Domestic Violence and 498a are already mentioned. Men’s rights to maintenance can vary under different Acts. Under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (As I mentioned it\'s for men to get maintenance as wive\'s living standards at marriage time are to be maintained) both husband and wife can claim maintenance, while only the woman can do so under the Special Marriage Act, 1954.Under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, the wife has to be paid maintenance in the iddat period and mehr has to be returned (Under Section 3 of the MWA, a Muslim husband is obligated to pay maintenance to his divorced wife within the iddat period. This provision has, in the past, been misinterpreted to mean that the husband is legally obligated to maintain his wife only ""during"" the iddat period. However, the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Daniel Latiffi v. Union of India14 has clarified that the maintenance payable by the husband to his wife during the iddat period covers the time period beyond the iddat period as well) . Christians: Under Section 37 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869, the divorced wife can get maintenance for life by applying in a civil or a high court.The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act, 1936, makes the husband liable to pay maintenance to wife for life if she remains unmarried after divorce, and can get a maximum of one-fifth of his net income.Further, in Lalita Toppo v. The State of Jharkhand, the Supreme Court has recognised the right of a woman in a live-in relationship to claim maintenance from her partner under the PWDA.(Protection of Women From Domestic Violence act)', 'More about muslim women Earlier, a Muslim woman could claim maintenance only under the Muslim personal law as laid down in the Quran under which a husband was liable to pay maintenance to his wife only during the period of \'iddat\'. However, the Supreme Court has, vide its landmark judgment in the Shah Bano case12 held that a Muslim woman is entitled to claim maintenance under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 irrespective of Muslim personal law. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that immediately after the Shah Bano verdict, the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986 (""MWA"") was enacted whereunder inter alia a Muslim woman is entitled to claim from her husband (i) a reasonable and fair provision and maintenance; (ii) an amount equal to the sum of mahr or dower agreed to be paid to her at the time of her marriage or at any time thereafter according to Muslim law; (iii) all the properties given to her before or at the time of marriage or after her marriage by her relatives or friends or her husband or any relatives of the husband or his friends; and (iv) in cases where the divorced woman herself maintains the children born to her before or after her divorce, a reasonable and fair provision and maintenance for a period of two years from the respective dates of birth of such children.', 'Also recently Uttarakhand state ', ' an ordinance to give co-ownership rights to women in their husband’s ancestral property', 'Read some High court statements like', 'and this ', ' too', 'Now other act named Public Safety Act The Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act, 1978 (PSA) is a preventive detention law under which a person is taken into custody to prevent them from acting harmfully against ""the security of the state or the maintenance of the public order\' in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir (now a union territory).The PSA violates international human rights law and standards by providing for detention without trial while denying the possibility of judicial review and other safeguards for those in detention required under international human rights law. During PSA detention, the detainee can be lodged in any suitable prison or subsidiary jail (such as a house) in India without any warrant, trial, or court hearing for a maximum of one or two years.In 2015 the government made public the figure of 16,329 persons having been detained under the act since 1988, nearly all from Kashmir.

Women have also traditionally not been a significant part of the armed groups. Although women take part in protests against the authorities, the police and security forces do certainly think twice about arresting or detaining women, as they know that this has the possibility of stirring trouble and bringing attention to themselves. Unfortunately this has not stopped women from continuing to face other human rights violations, particularly rape and other forms of sexual assault.”' Can you see the male disposability here? It's very much clear. Attention will come if women will be detained but is not coming when men are being mistreated at regular basis.

There are various reasons for under-reporting, but foremost among them are our social system and values attached to men, which stop them from sharing and reporting domestic violence and abuse. Even when men report domestic abuse and violence, most people do not believe them. When men try to narrate their problems, torture, struggle, and harassment within marriage and family, no one listens to them; instead, people laugh at them. Many men are ashamed of talking about and sharing that they are beaten by their wives (Sarkar, Dsouza,& Dasgupta, 2007).One needs to understand that dynamics of domestic violence and abuse among men and women are different, and reasons, purposes, and motives are often very different. There are various studies on dynamics of violence against women, but there are limited studies on the issue of domestic violence and abuse against men. The study by Save Family Foundation (Sarkar et al., 2007), which interviewed 1,650 husbands between the ages of 15 and 49 years, selected through random sampling using a schedule adapted from the WHO multicountry study on husband’s health and domestic violence, reports that economical violence (32.8%) is common, followed by emotional violence (22.2%), physical violence (25.2%), and sexual violence (17.7%). The study shows that the probability of violence increased significantly with the duration of marriage, particularly if it was more than 7 years old. It also shows that husbands who experienced some form of violence during their first year of marriage continued to experience the same for the rest of their lives. It is not something that just goes away. The study shows that domestic violence is a public health issue with far-reaching health consequences, such as mental illness and stress disorders, that need to be addressed. The study also shows that domestic violence is perpetrated across all socioeconomic classes (see Table 1). The study reports that a high proportion of husbands who experienced domestic violence were well educated and earning good money. Men tolerate and stay in abusive and violent relationship for many reasons. Some of the reasons ‘‘why men tolerate domestic violence and abuse’’ are the belief and hope that things would get better, fear of losing social respect and position, protection, and love toward their children and family. Many abused men feel that they have to make their marriages work. They are afraid that if things fall apart, they will be blamed. Many abused men also believe that it is their fault and feel that they deserve the treatment they receive. Another reason is increasing economic and other dependency on women. The Labor and Employment Ministry data for 2001–2005 reports that the number of women getting employment is higher than for men. The report (Sarkar et al., 2007) also shows that the number of employed men dropped by 14 lakh, from 228.4 lakh in 2001 to 214.4 lakh in 2005. In cases where an abused man is mentally, emotionally, or financially dependent on the woman, the idea of leaving the relationship generates feeling of depression and anxiety.', 'Rape : Acc. to a ', ' by National Women and Children comission carried out in 2007, when 53.2% of children reported having experienced some form of sexual abuse.

His wife and other family members who were travelling with him escaped with injuries. His wife, an eyewitness, told Tiruppur motor accident claims tribunal that a van which was going in front of their car turned right without showing any signal and their car rammed against the van and her husband died in the impact.The tribunal, however, fixed 75% contributory negligence on the victim based on police FIR, which blamed Babu for negligent driving, and awarded Rs 10.4 lakh as compensation by fixing Babu’s monthly income at Rs 20,000 per month.Aggrieved by the order, the family moved the HC. In August 2018, Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice Krishnan Ramasamy of the Madras HC quashed the order of the tribunal and held that since there was no rebuttal witness provided by the insurance company, the accident happened only due to the negligence of the van driver. Taking into consideration the victim’s tax records and pay slip, the court fixed the victim’s annual income at 12.3 lakh and computed the compensation to be paid by the insurance company as 1.85 crore.Agreeing with the HC ruling, the Supreme Court bench said, “In view of such evidence on record, there is no reason to give weightage to the contents of the FIR.

While some residents drew out the problem with only launching another helpline, some even gave valuable suggestions albeit with a pinch of salt.

Anusha S Natesh stated, ""Is it possible we have an app that connects BESCOM and BBMP? Tar is laid on roads and next week BESCOM comes for Internet or there is a water connection request, and the new road is now again with potholes from being dug! We only get to enjoy new roads for a week.""

Recently, when author and historian Vikram Sampath, vented out his anger about the ""colossal mess that Koramangala in Bangalore is..."", his followers and fellow residents turned to show him how similarly pathetic, the condition of other city roads has been.

Ever since the fatal accidents have come into the limelight, Bengaluru citizens have been taking to their social media to make fellow city dwellers and authorities aware of the pathetic situation in their respective areas.

A senior citizen residing in Indiranagar who didn't wish to be named told IBTimes, ""Walking the streets of one of the better-known areas like Indiranagar is an everyday struggle.

According to the initial order issued by the Urban Development Department (UDD), BBMP's deadline to finish the delimitation of wards was July this year.

The court of inquiry appointed into the Mangaluru crash therefore had made several recommendations. But the Kozhikode investigation team found that a number of salient recommendations were not wholly addressed.Among the recommendations ignored was that of having adequate pilots based permanently in important stations. For instance, though Air India Express operates maximum flights out of Kozhikode airport, it had posted only one captain as against 26 first officers, the Kozhikode crash report said. The commander of the ill-fated Kozhikode crash flight was scheduled to fly the next day morning. Had he diverted the aircraft to another airport, he would not have been available to operate the next day’s flight and he was aware that there were no additional captains at that base, other than himself to operate that flight, the report said. Another critical aspect was assertiveness training for first officers. In the Kozhikode accident, the co-pilot failed to take over the controls from the commander, though the latter continued with the unsafe descent to land.With regards to airport infrastructure recommendations, ten years later, neither does the Mangaluru airport nor does the Kozhikode airport have runway centre line lights. The airports don’t have a soft area beyond the paved runway surface to stop an overrunning aircraft. As for the aviation regulator, its flight inspectors were required to carry out frequent flying checks on sectors involving flights to table-top runways. But the Kozhikode investigation team found no flying checks were carried out by DGCA from January 2019 to June 2020 on these critical airports.","MUMBAI: The Air India Express Kozhikode crash in August last year had ‘glaring similarities’ with the Air India Express Mangaluru that occurred in May 2010, said the recently released final investigation report into the Kozhikode accident.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in its 281-page Kozhikode final report made over forty references to the Mangaluru accident and the recommendations issued later by its court of inquiry.
