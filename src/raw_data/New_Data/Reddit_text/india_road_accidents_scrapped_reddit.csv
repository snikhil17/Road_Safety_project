The accident occurred around 4:00am at Puranpur in the state’s Pilibhit district, some 250km from state capital Lucknow.

Witnesses told the police that the bus was travelling at high speed and the driver had failed to spot the SUV coming from the opposite direction while taking a blind turn on the road, leading to the collision.

‘The impact was such that the bus rolled down the road into a nearby field before coming to a halt. The long-distance bus was ferrying passengers from Lucknow to Puranpur, when the accident happened,’ Pilibhit police chief Jai Prakash told the media.

While seven people, mostly bus passengers, died on the spot, two others died from their injuries at two local hospitals, where 30 others have been admitted to with injuries.

‘The condition of at least four of the injured is serious,’ a doctor said.

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has offered his condolences to the kin of those killed in the accident and announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each of the families.

‘A probe has been ordered into the accident, and the bus driver booked for rash and negligent driving,’ the police chief said.

Road accidents are very common in India, with one taking place every four minutes. These accidents are often blamed on poor roads, rash driving and scant regard for traffic laws.

Indian government’s implementation of stricter traffic laws in recent years have failed to rein in accidents, which claim over 100,000 lives every year.","The accident occurred around 4:00am at Puranpur in the state’s Pilibhit district, some 250km from state capital Lucknow.

The country accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, in which 1.5 lakh people die.

""India tops the world in road crash deaths and injuries. It has 1 per cent of the world's vehicles but accounts for 11 per cent of all road crash deaths, witnessing 53 road crashes every hour; killing 1 person every 4 minutes,"" the report said.

In the last decade, 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh got injured on Indian roads, it said.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways crash numbers"", the report estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crore or 3.14 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).

The 2019 World Bank report, titled 'Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles', puts the road crash and serious injury cost estimate at 7.5 per cent of India's GDP or Rs 12.9 lakh crore for 2016. It is more than twice the figure cited by the government at 3 per cent of GDP or Rs 4.3 lakh crore, it added.

A recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) estimates the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 per cent of the country's GDP.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for MoRTH crash numbers, the same study estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crores i.e. equivalent to 3.14 per cent,"" it said.

At the individual level, road crash injuries and deaths impose a severe financial burden and push entire (non-poor) households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

As per the Ministry, 76.2 per cent of people who are killed in road crashes are in their prime working-age, 18-45 years.

Globally, road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the eighth leading cause of death.

‘Poor, male road-users of working age, constitute VRU category’

According to the World Bank, the road crash fatality rate is three times higher in low-income countries compared to high-income countries, and statistics from India further reinforce this global trend.

There is a distinct correlation between socio-economic status and road use patterns in low- and middle-income countries like India and ""poor people are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crash"", it said.

In a country like India, where vulnerable road users are forced to share space with other less vulnerable road users, the income level of an individual has a direct bearing on the mode of transport used.

This in turn further determines the level of risk faced by a particular road user. The report said daily wage workers and workers employed as casual labourers in informal activities are more prone to be defined as vulnerable compared to workers engaged in regular activities.

""It is no coincidence, then, that it is often the poor, especially male road-users of working age, that constitute the category of vulnerable road users (VRUs) in India.

""VRUs bear a disproportionately large burden of road crashes and account for more than half of all road crash deaths and serious injuries in the country,"" it said.

As the world navigates through the Covid-19 pandemic, the road crash pandemic continues to fester the socio-economic landscape in India, the report said.

On Saturday, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gakdari has termed road accident scenario in India more ""dangerous than the Covid-19 pandemic"". He has said there could be a saving of Rs 90 lakh per person by preventing deaths and reducing injuries to minor ones in such incidents.

The Minister had stressed that the accident cost is a tremendous burden to society and the nation, and the estimated cost of a death in a road accident is around Rs 91.16 lakh.

Releasing the World Bank report on 'Traffic Crash Injuries And Disabilities: The Burden on India Society', Gadkari had said that in this alarming scenario, his ministry will formulate policies to protect the interest of the poor and embark on several reformative steps.","With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank.

Addressing the 'Karmayogis' of Border Road Organisation (BRO) via video conferencing, the Union Defence Minister said, ""Accidents on the roads are a cause of great concern for us today. It is a matter of great surprise that our country has less than 3 per cent of the world's total vehicles, but accidents are close to 11 per cent. Every year around 4.5-5 lakh accidents and 1.5 lakh unfortunate deaths occur in the country. It is not less than a silent pandemic.""

""To get rid of all this, whatever steps the government has taken, such as approving the 'National Road Safety Policy', bringing in the 'Motor Vehicle Act 2020', identifying black spots on national highways...these centres also have their own importance,"" he said. BRO on Friday launched four new software for works management, road infrastructure digitisation, human resource management and recruitment management.

""The four software being launched today will bring efficiency to the work of the organization and will also save their time. Their creation also marks the success of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' and 'Digital India' campaigns,"" stated Singh. The Union Defence Minister said the start of two 'Centres of Excellence' based on the study of 'Road Safety', and roads, bridges, tunnels, air-fields is a matter of great pride for the country. He said these centres complement each other in their objectives.

""Right from its inception, BRO has been playing a vital role in the progress of the nation by building roads, tunnels and other infrastructure in remote areas. The most important component is connectivity. For connectivity, our BRO personnel have been working tirelessly even in the midst of difficulties like severe winter, heat, rain, snowfall. In the last 5-7 years, BRO has made even more remarkable achievements,"" he said. He emphasised the increase in the budget of BRO by three to four times during the last five to seven years is not a trivial matter. Apart from this, 3,270 sets of special high altitude clothing are approved for our engineers and other personnel.

The Union Defence Minister further mentioned the slogans like ""Sawdhani hati durghatna ghati"" also helps making people aware while on road. Singh further extended his best wishes to woman biker Kanchan for her solo expedition.

""I feel good knowing about Kanchan ji who is going to start solo women motorcycle expedition today. I was told that at an early age she started riding a motorcycle. So far she has covered 21,000 km in 10 years. I wish her all the best for this expedition,"" he said. (ANI)

The country accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, in which 1.5 lakh people die.

""India tops the world in road crash deaths and injuries. It has 1 per cent of the world's vehicles but accounts for 11 per cent of all road crash deaths, witnessing 53 road crashes every hour; killing 1 person every 4 minutes,"" the report said.

In the last decade, 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh got injured on Indian roads, it said.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways crash numbers"", the report estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crore or 3.14 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).

The 2019 World Bank report, titled 'Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles', puts the road crash and serious injury cost estimate at 7.5 per cent of India's GDP or Rs 12.9 lakh crore for 2016. It is more than twice the figure cited by the government at 3 per cent of GDP or Rs 4.3 lakh crore, it added.

A recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) estimates the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 per cent of the country's GDP.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for MoRTH crash numbers, the same study estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crores i.e. equivalent to 3.14 per cent,"" it said.

At the individual level, road crash injuries and deaths impose a severe financial burden and push entire (non-poor) households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

As per the Ministry, 76.2 per cent of people who are killed in road crashes are in their prime working-age, 18-45 years.

Globally, road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the eighth leading cause of death.

‘Poor, male road-users of working age, constitute VRU category’

According to the World Bank, the road crash fatality rate is three times higher in low-income countries compared to high-income countries, and statistics from India further reinforce this global trend.

There is a distinct correlation between socio-economic status and road use patterns in low- and middle-income countries like India and ""poor people are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crash"", it said.

In a country like India, where vulnerable road users are forced to share space with other less vulnerable road users, the income level of an individual has a direct bearing on the mode of transport used.

This in turn further determines the level of risk faced by a particular road user. The report said daily wage workers and workers employed as casual labourers in informal activities are more prone to be defined as vulnerable compared to workers engaged in regular activities.

""It is no coincidence, then, that it is often the poor, especially male road-users of working age, that constitute the category of vulnerable road users (VRUs) in India.

""VRUs bear a disproportionately large burden of road crashes and account for more than half of all road crash deaths and serious injuries in the country,"" it said.

As the world navigates through the Covid-19 pandemic, the road crash pandemic continues to fester the socio-economic landscape in India, the report said.

On Saturday, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gakdari has termed road accident scenario in India more ""dangerous than the Covid-19 pandemic"". He has said there could be a saving of Rs 90 lakh per person by preventing deaths and reducing injuries to minor ones in such incidents.

The Minister had stressed that the accident cost is a tremendous burden to society and the nation, and the estimated cost of a death in a road accident is around Rs 91.16 lakh.

Releasing the World Bank report on 'Traffic Crash Injuries And Disabilities: The Burden on India Society', Gadkari had said that in this alarming scenario, his ministry will formulate policies to protect the interest of the poor and embark on several reformative steps.","With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank.

National Safety Day is observed annually on 4th March to mark the foundation of National Safety to emphasize the importance of public safety. It could be bad roads, ill structured traffic rules and regulations, that cause such high rates of road accidents but the endeavour has been to promote safety and security.

On the National Safety Day, let’s look at the countries with highest number of road accidents and also, see where India features:

PERU: It has been reported to have experienced 14 out of 100,000 road accidents, every year.Indonesia: While Indonesia scores high on traffic jams, it’s road accident rate is 15 out of 100,000.

COLUMBIA: 17/100000 is Columbia’s road accident death number. The scenario is quite scary owing to its poorly managed traffic condition.

INDIA: In India the number is akin to Columbia’s. Being a hugely populated country, with erratic pedestrians, crossing; cars honking, no adherence to rules, the norms of safety are highly jeopardized.

RUSSIA: Another surprisingly prominent country making its way up to the list is Russia with 19 out of 100000 death cases, annually. It is known for many road rage incidents, too.

CHINA: It seems China is a step ahead in recording the road accidents, too, apart from many other things. It again has been observed to experience frequent accidents. 19 out of 100000 fatality rates have been documented.

BRAZIL: 23 out of 100000 is Brazil’s fatality rate. Death due to mishap on roads is a growing concern in this country.

According to report submitted by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in Parliament on Thursday, India witnessed 35% less accidents on road in the first six months of this year, compared to the same period in the previous six years.

Less accidents also meant less fatalities, which has come down by around 30%.

India, on an average, witnesses about 5 lakh road accidents per annum in which about 1.5 lakh people die and about 3 lakh are crippled.

The number of accidents from April to June this year (50,336) was 55% less than the corresponding number last year (1,12,215). In terms of fatalities in road accidents, 56,288 people died in the first six months of this year compared to 79,678 in the same period last year, a drop of about 30%.

On an average, nearly 2,48,000 road accidents were reported between January and June each year between 2014 and 2019. The month-wise breakup of accidents for the previous years is from annual reports on road accidents published by the ministry of road transport and highways, and annual reports on accidental deaths and suicides published by the ministry of home affairs.

There was a drop in the number of road accidents between 2019 and 2020 in all states and union territories except three small northeastern states – Meghalaya, Sikkim and Nagaland. Among big states, the largest percentage drop in the number of road accidents was seen in Karnataka (48%). Delhi reported a 46% drop in accidents this year.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways is also working on improved traffic system to bring down the numbers further in coming days. Union Minister Nitin Gadkari recently said that there is a need for a policy on public private partnership (PPP) model for an intelligent traffic system to reduce road accidents. He also said it is his endeavour to reduce these numbers by at least 25 per cent by the fiscal-end.

Earlier this year, Gadkari reaffirmed India's commitment to the United Nation’s goal set under the UN Decade of Action of drastically reducing road accidents by 2030.","With cars and bikes off the roads for most part of this year, thanks to lockdowns and travel bans due to ongoing coronavirus pandemic, India has witnessed a significant drop in number of road accidents in 2020.

More than a third (37%) of those killed in road accidents in 2019 were two-wheeler riders, noted a Ministry of Road Transport and Highways’ report published in October this year.

More crashes and deaths are resulting from faulty licensing laws, no training, poor roads and unsafe helmets. Just correct helmet use could reduce the risk of fatal injuries by 42% and head injuries by 69%, a World Health Organization report said.

India needs stricter licensing laws and must ensure the use of proper helmets through effective communication and fines, experts told IndiaSpend. Mandatory and proper training for riding and handling two-wheelers is a must, as is an overall improvement in road infrastructure. Also, India must bolster public transport in order to reduce traffic.

Bike sales grow with income

As the gross national income per capita rises, the number of two-wheelers also increases. The poorer the country, the higher the growth, according to The United Nations Motorcycle Helmet Study published in 2016. An exponential, growth in a country’s two-wheeler fleet might result in a rapid increase in the number of motorcycle crashes.

India witnessed a rapid growth in per capita incomes in the last decade, which also led to people buying more vehicles – particularly two-wheelers – according to a study by the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bangalore. India’s per capita income grew by 28% between 2013 and 2017 while two-wheeler registrations increased by 46% (compared to 44% overall new vehicle registrations) over the same period.

Last year, 2.12 crore two-wheelers were sold in India and the annual sales are projected to reach 2.66 crore units by 2025 at 2.6% growth rate, according to UnivDatos .

Alongside the increase in income and the subsequent rise in the number of vehicles, India also witnessed concrete or tarred surface road growth of 4.18% from 1951-2018 . However, all this has not been accompanied by a corresponding improvement in regulation and regulatory infrastructure necessary to protect and educate vulnerable road users, pointed out experts.

There is barely any education on road safety in India, said Vir Nakai, 41, a Mumbai-based motorcyclist and brand strategist for bike manufacturers.

“Safety is not high on our agenda... whether it is issuing driving licences or formulating and enforcing traffic rules,” said Nakai, who has been riding motorcycles across the country for over two decades. “That is the main reason why we have to deal with hazards like parked vehicles on main roads, people riding and driving on the wrong side, little regard for traffic lights and complete lack of lane discipline. Motorcyclists are a small thing on the road and no one cares about them.”

Together, two-wheelers and pedestrians account for 54% of accident-related deaths in India and are the most vulnerable category in line with global trends, according to the ministry report . While 37% of road accident deaths (56,136) – or six every hour, on average – involved two-wheelers, pedestrians made up 17% and cyclists 3%. There were 449,002 road accidents leading to 151,113 deaths, making Indian roads the deadliest in the world, the report noted. India accounts for 11% of the global road accident fatalities.

Mobility and motorcycles

Motorcycles and scooters, given their price-point and availability, are a convenient alternative to the inadequate public transport that exists outside of the big cities, said Nakai. The average commute time for surveyed two-wheeler riders in Pune was just about 30 minutes while commuting by public transport typically took much longer, found a 2014 research by World Resources Institute .

“Scooters or two-wheelers are seen more as family vehicles in rural and semi-urban areas,” said Bhargab Maitra, a professor of infrastructure design at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. “You will see that bike sales are higher in these areas but enforcement of traffic laws is a lot more lax.”

“Most places of work are in cities while the workers tend to stay in the suburbs as housing prices within the city are too high for many to afford,” said Tej Prakash Sinha, head of emergency medicine of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.

While cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata have metro and local train services and others such as Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai are developing their metro coverage, most of India does not have proper public transport services. Hence people are forced to travel long distances daily and bikes make the commute faster and easier, he added.

Poor licensing laws, little training

Vehicles driven by untrained and unqualified drivers are a serious traffic hazard. Road accidents involving drivers without a valid driving license increased from 37,585 in 2018 to 44,358 in 2019, an increase of 18%, and accounted for 9.9% of the total accidents, the transport ministry data showed.

“At least, car drivers do go through some level of training before they are issued a driving license in India,” said Piyush Tewari, founder of SaveLIFE Foundation . “This is a missing factor for many two-wheeler riders. There is almost negligible training that people undergo in terms of crash prevention, road safety rules... they just learn how to operate the bike. So that is a major overall contributor to crashes.”

The ministry data also revealed that about 72% of road accidents involved drivers holding a valid driver license. Of 317 victims of traumatic brain injury from road accidents studied for a 2018 AIIMS paper , only two-thirds were carrying a “formal driving license”; only one had a learner’s license.

The driving license for two-wheelers is almost a joke, said Nakai.

“I took a written test for my driving licence and then drove in a car for the road test,” he recalled. “After finishing my drive, the person assessing me noticed I had applied for both two-wheelers and cars. When I said I would drop off the car and come back with a bike in a few minutes, he said, ‘Since you can drive a car, you would know how to ride a motorcycle.’ That was how it was.”

Given the kind of motorcycles available in the market now, such oversight in granting licences is dangerous. “Most riders in India do not have sufficient training to handle motorcycles like a KTM-390 (a powerful and very fast motorcycle) or other such bikes,” added Nakai. “The skills needed to handle and ride these bigger bikes are very different from riding a basic motorcycle. One needs to undergo special training to be able to ride them safely. But, in India, if you have a driving license, it is a blanket permit to ride anything from a scooty to a Hayabusa [superbike] and here everybody gets a two-wheeler license.”

In contrast, Singapore has multi-tiered license categories and minimum age requirements corresponding to the power of the bikes. A Grade 1 license for 100cc bikes is issued at 18 years of age, and only after more training and at the age of 19 years one can apply for a Grade 2 for 150-200cc two-wheelers and a Grade 3 license for superbikes is issued at the age of 20, said Tewari. “At the moment, a 19-year-old in India could get a learner’s license and drive a superbike, which is almost like a weapon in the hands of untrained youngsters,” he said.

Road infrastructure and vehicle design

Suchi Vora, 34, an architect in Pune, has been riding two-wheelers since she was 16 even though she started learning how to ride one when she was a 13-year-old like many of her peers did at the time in her hometown. The roads on which she started riding in the 1990s have come a long way and are much improved today, she said.

“The city’s road and infrastructure have advanced tremendously from the time I first started riding but they have become more dangerous too,” said Vora. “The city roads are a patchwork at best. They are uneven and riddled with potholes, which are practically deathtraps. There are more people speeding on our streets and the traffic has become a lot worse compared to the improvement in city roads. In the outskirts, the roads are still pretty bad. I do not feel safe taking my scooty to far away places… I use a car. There is always someone coming from the wrong side or jumping signals. You never know what could hit you if you switch off even for a minute.”

“Two-wheelers are becoming more fuel efficient and hence their popularity is high in both rural and urban areas,” said Maitra of IIT. “The road infrastructure is growing as well but it is not keeping pace with the growing number of vehicles and also the quality of the road infrastructure is not up to the mark.”

On national highways, on average, driving on the wrong side of the road caused 5.2% and drunken driving led to 3.7% of the accidents, according to the government report.

“Our road infrastructure is not very forgiving, one violation could lead to an accident,” added Maitra. “This is especially true in the case of two-wheeler drivers. Even though cars also violate rules, they are at least protected by the vehicle in some ways.”

While road and infrastructure development has been sluggish, two-wheelers have evolved at a much faster pace and the current vehicles available in India are far more efficient, powerful and speedier than the scooters that the majority used to ride in the 1990s, experts and bikers told IndiaSpend. “While the scooters and bikes of the 1990s used to struggle to accelerate, motorcycles available in India today have become a lot faster,” said Nakai. “Two-wheeler development has far outpaced infrastructure development in our country.”

This is where road and vehicle design clash. The current speed limit in the country is 80 km/h on a four-lane highway. Even the entry-level 100cc motorcycles hit speeds of 80 km/h without much trouble.

Overspeeding caused, on average, 71.6% of all road accidents on national highways, the Central report said. If the speed limit on our roads is reduced to about 55 km/h -57 km/h, we could save around 30% to 37% lives, according to an advisor to the WHO, as IndiaSpend reported .

Helmets and trauma injury

Almost everyone in India who has ridden a bike or scooter has done so without a helmet at least once in their lives, noted Nakai. “A huge number of bikers do not wear a helmet and among those who wear one, a lot of the helmets are of poor quality,” he noted. “Again, this is because of our attitude towards safety. We do not take safety seriously.” Not wearing helmets resulted in deaths of 44,666 (30,148 drivers and 14,518 pillions) or 29.82% of total road accident fatalities during 2019, according to the ministry data .

Correct helmet use can lead to a 42% reduction in the risk of fatal injuries and a 69% reduction in the risk of head injuries according to the WHO . “Oftentimes, we have seen that it [death] is because of either not wearing a helmet or wearing a very poor quality helmet,” said Tewari. “Another challenge is implementing the helmet rule and availability of affordable and quality helmets right now.”

The country accounts for about 4.5 lakh road crashes per annum, in which 1.5 lakh people die.

""India tops the world in road crash deaths and injuries. It has 1 per cent of the world's vehicles but accounts for 11 per cent of all road crash deaths, witnessing 53 road crashes every hour; killing 1 person every 4 minutes,"" the report said.

In the last decade, 13 lakh people died and another 50 lakh got injured on Indian roads, it said.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways crash numbers"", the report estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crore or 3.14 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).

The 2019 World Bank report, titled 'Guide for Road Safety Opportunities and Challenges: Low- and Middle-Income Countries Country Profiles', puts the road crash and serious injury cost estimate at 7.5 per cent of India's GDP or Rs 12.9 lakh crore for 2016. It is more than twice the figure cited by the government at 3 per cent of GDP or Rs 4.3 lakh crore, it added.

A recent study commissioned by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) estimates the socio-economic costs of road crashes at Rs 1,47,114 crore in India, which is equivalent to 0.77 per cent of the country's GDP.

""Considering the under reporting phenomenon and using the crash ratios for MoRTH crash numbers, the same study estimates the crash costs at Rs 5.96 lakh crores i.e. equivalent to 3.14 per cent,"" it said.

At the individual level, road crash injuries and deaths impose a severe financial burden and push entire (non-poor) households into poverty and the already poor into debt.

As per the Ministry, 76.2 per cent of people who are killed in road crashes are in their prime working-age, 18-45 years.

Globally, road traffic injuries (RTIs) are the eighth leading cause of death.

‘Poor, male road-users of working age, constitute VRU category’

According to the World Bank, the road crash fatality rate is three times higher in low-income countries compared to high-income countries, and statistics from India further reinforce this global trend.

There is a distinct correlation between socio-economic status and road use patterns in low- and middle-income countries like India and ""poor people are more likely to be involved in a road traffic crash"", it said.

In a country like India, where vulnerable road users are forced to share space with other less vulnerable road users, the income level of an individual has a direct bearing on the mode of transport used.

This in turn further determines the level of risk faced by a particular road user. The report said daily wage workers and workers employed as casual labourers in informal activities are more prone to be defined as vulnerable compared to workers engaged in regular activities.

""It is no coincidence, then, that it is often the poor, especially male road-users of working age, that constitute the category of vulnerable road users (VRUs) in India.

""VRUs bear a disproportionately large burden of road crashes and account for more than half of all road crash deaths and serious injuries in the country,"" it said.

As the world navigates through the Covid-19 pandemic, the road crash pandemic continues to fester the socio-economic landscape in India, the report said.

On Saturday, Road Transport, Highways and MSMEs Minister Nitin Gakdari has termed road accident scenario in India more ""dangerous than the Covid-19 pandemic"". He has said there could be a saving of Rs 90 lakh per person by preventing deaths and reducing injuries to minor ones in such incidents.

The Minister had stressed that the accident cost is a tremendous burden to society and the nation, and the estimated cost of a death in a road accident is around Rs 91.16 lakh.

Releasing the World Bank report on 'Traffic Crash Injuries And Disabilities: The Burden on India Society', Gadkari had said that in this alarming scenario, his ministry will formulate policies to protect the interest of the poor and embark on several reformative steps.","With only 1 per cent of the world's vehicles, India accounts for 11 per cent of the global death in road accidents, the highest in the world, according to a report by the World Bank.

The situation is alarming... there are more deaths than in COVID-19...It is more dangerous than COVID-19,"" Gadkari said terming the World Bank report an eye-opener.In India cost per seriously injured person comes at Rs 3.64 lakh while cost per minor injured person stands at Rs 77, 938 and the cost per death is estimated at Rs 91.16 lakh, he said.""So death cost is 100 times more than injury cost.

The centre claimed the fines would curb road accidents. But latest government data show the reality was mixed and the fear of the law may have fizzled out quite soon.

A total of 154,732 people died on Indian roads in 437,396 accidents last year, the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB’s) latest update shows. Around 139,000 of these accidents took place after the increased penalties kicked in on 1 September, 2019. Compared to the same period in 2018, this was a 4% drop.

But a closer look shows the decline was the sharpest (7.5%) in September, and began tapering October onward. A year-on-year comparison adjusts for seasonal effects since September anyway sees the fewest road accidents every year.





The NCRB gets the data on accidents and accidental deaths from state police bureaus. Due to underreporting, actual death counts could be 47-63% higher than official data, according to IIT Delhi’s Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Programme.

The World Health Organization’s estimate of accident deaths in India in 2016 was two times the government tally. This analysis focuses largely on accidents in cities, where reporting is typically better.

“When the new law was announced, a lot of people suddenly started behaving on the road, such as stopping much before the zebra crossing and so on,"" said Piyush Tewari, chief executive officer of road safety nonprofit SaveLIFE Foundation. But within weeks, the deterrence factor got lost, and the situation has “gone back to what it was"", he said.

Kamal Soi, a member of the centre’s National Road Safety Council, agreed the impact fizzled out “a little"" and said enforcement agencies needed to keep up the momentum. Results can be expected only if the rules are enforced rigorously for at least 18 months, he said.

Gaps in implementation varied by state. Some of the most accident-prone cities and states reported a more sustained decline September onwards, but others did not. Due to public anger and political concerns, some states—even those ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party—decided to delay or reduce the fines. For instance, Gujarat’s penalties are lower than the centrally mandated ones, and Odisha implemented them only in March 2020.

States have to “enforce the rules not for the central government, but for their own citizens"", Soi said. “States that are not applying it are risking lives,"" he added.





Deaths due to dangerous driving and overspeeding—the biggest killers on Indian roads— increased in 2019. As many as 128,798 people lost their lives due to dangerous driving and overspeeding—83% of all road accident deaths, the NCRB data showed. This was a 2.2% rise since 2018.

In the new regime, the recommended penalty for overspeeding ranges between ₹1,000 and ₹4,000, depending on vehicle type. Dangerous driving is punishable with at least six months in prison, or a fine of ₹1,000 to ₹10,000, or both.

But only three of the six most accident-prone states—Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh—were able to reduce accidents due to dangerous driving and overspeeding. These three states, along with Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala, report the most road accidents year after year. Last year, these six accounted for 58% of all road accidents in India.





Most road accident deaths take place on national and state highways, even though they make up just about 5% of the Indian road network. In India’s 53 most populous cities, highways have a 42% share in accident deaths, but this rises to 62% in the rest of India, shows the data. This could be because of higher traffic density in cities, leading to lower speeds, Soi said.

There were 113 accidents for each 100 km of national highways, 61 on state highways, and just four on other roads.





The risk on highways can be mitigated through electronic enforcement, which is mandated by the Section 136A of the Motor Vehicles Act, and touted by the centre as one of the key features of the 2019 amendments. But very few states are using it, Tewari said.

Road accidents cost India dearly. The age group of 18 to 45 is involved in 70% of them, shows government data.

If India can halve the casualties in road accidents for 24 years, it can improve its per capita income by 14%, according to the World Bank.

India’s union roads minister Nitin Gadkari may have hoped that the new law will act as a strong deterrent. But the resistance from the rest of the political establishment seems to have diluted its impact. This year, the pandemic-induced lockdown may have saved many lives by taking traffic off our roads. But as traffic returns to usual levels across cities, the risks of accidental deaths are also likely to rise.

The centre claimed the fines would curb road accidents. But latest government data show the reality was mixed and the fear of the law may have fizzled out quite soon.

A total of 154,732 people died on Indian roads in 437,396 accidents last year, the National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB’s) latest update shows. Around 139,000 of these accidents took place after the increased penalties kicked in on 1 September, 2019. Compared to the same period in 2018, this was a 4% drop.

But a closer look shows the decline was the sharpest (7.5%) in September, and began tapering October onward. A year-on-year comparison adjusts for seasonal effects since September anyway sees the fewest road accidents every year.





The NCRB gets the data on accidents and accidental deaths from state police bureaus. Due to underreporting, actual death counts could be 47-63% higher than official data, according to IIT Delhi’s Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Programme.

The World Health Organization’s estimate of accident deaths in India in 2016 was two times the government tally. This analysis focuses largely on accidents in cities, where reporting is typically better.

“When the new law was announced, a lot of people suddenly started behaving on the road, such as stopping much before the zebra crossing and so on,"" said Piyush Tewari, chief executive officer of road safety nonprofit SaveLIFE Foundation. But within weeks, the deterrence factor got lost, and the situation has “gone back to what it was"", he said.

India continued to have the most road fatalities in the world, followed by China, a distant second at 63,093 deaths in 2,12,846 road accidents in 2019, the report revealed. The United States of America (USA) reported the most road accidents at 2,211,439, and witnessed 37,461 deaths in 2019.

According to the report, speeding was the leading cause of deaths, while, in terms of vehicles, two-wheelers were involved in most road fatalities.

Across states, most road accidents were reported in Tamil Nadu (57,228), followed by Madhya Pradesh (50,669), Uttar Pradesh (42,572), Kerala (41,111) and Karnataka (40,658) accidents.

Maharashtra ranked sixth with 32,295 accidents, but saw the second-highest number of fatalities (12,788), after 22,655 in Uttar Pradesh.

Among cities, Delhi retained its first rank with 1,463 deaths, followed by Jaipur (1,283), Chennai (1,252) and Bengaluru (768).

Mumbai ranked ninth with 447 people being killed in road accidents in 2019.

The report stated that national and state highways, which account for just five per cent of the total roads in the country, saw the most deaths — 61% of the total.

Two-wheelers were involved in 37% of the road deaths in the country, followed by pedestrians at 17% and light vehicles (comprising cars, jeeps and taxis) at 16%. A total of 56,136 people riding two-wheelers lost their lives, while 25,858 pedestrians died in 2019, stated the report.

The report stated that speeding accounted for most road accidents and deaths (ranging between 63% and 73% for accidents and between 62% and 70% for deaths) on all categories of national highways.

In 2019, like in previous years, young adults in the age group of 18-45 years accounted for nearly 69.3% of road accident deaths, while those in the age group of 18 – 60 accounted for 84.3%.

Interestingly, it wasn’t curved roads that took the most lives — 96,624 people lost their lives on straight roads, while curved roads saw 20,141 deaths.

“Traditionally, for any accident or crash, the major causes could be ‘driver/human’, ‘road infrastructure’ or ‘vehicle-related factors’. Sometimes, there might be combinations of these factors which might lead to accidents. Among these major factors, ‘driver/human’-related factors or errors dominate,” said Nagendra R Velaga, associate professor (transportation systems engineering), department of civil engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay. Examples of such human/driver factors include — rash driving, fatigue/sleep deprivation (particularly for long-haul truck drivers), speeding (due to certain reasons like time pressure or time constraints to reach the destination), on-board distractions (eg: using digital devices such as mobile phones while driving), driving under influence of alcohol and drugs, among other, said Velaga.

“Advanced technologies and artificial intelligence can control some human errors or driver factors (for example, camera-based speed-detection system). However, I strongly feel that it is the individual’s responsibility to respect their own life use required and appropriate precautionary measures (use seatbelt and helmet, follow traffic rules, and do not use phone while driving, avoid rash driving and drunk driving),” added Velaga

Former chairman of the Supreme Court (SC) committee on road safety, retired justice KS Radhakrishnan, said speeding is the major cause of accidents, especially on straight roads and highways, where control on speed is minimal. On curved roads, speeding is less, due to which accidents are less. “Condition of roads, traffic violations, drink and drive, among others, are also major contributors to high number of fatalities and accidents,” said Radhakrishnan.

Radhakrishnan, whose committee conducted 250 meetings with the government, national highways authority, state traffic departments and international agencies, to curb accidents, said, “The meetings are heading in the right direction,” said Radhakrishnan. “The fine in India is not a deterrent,” said Radhakrishnan adding, “However, the average person here will not be able to afford heavy fines. The government will just end up seizing licences.”

To bring down fatalities, Velaga said, “In addition to national-level policies and legislation, regional or local-level control strategies or measures are required. Strong enforcement is also required.”

Velaga also said, “Causal and impact analysis of accidents/crashes is required for state, regional and local level. More focus on research related to human/driver factors may be needed to understand the exact of factors influencing the crashes and suitable remedial measures.”

Commenting on the report, Piyush Tewari, CEO and founder, SaveLIFE Foundation said, “There is an urgent need for full implementation of the road safety provisions in the motor vehicle (amendment) Act 2019, including implementation of child safety provisions. Additionally, identifying risk factors specific to the safety of children and creating a plan to mitigate them should be prioritised by all state governments.”","India continued to have the most road fatalities in the world, followed by China, a distant second at 63,093 deaths in 2,12,846 road accidents in 2019, the report revealed.

Son of a doctor couple, he was an alumnus of Guindy Engineering College and he did his MS in the US and was working there. He was a former 50-metre national record holder. He went on to win the gold in the 50-metre backstroke and silver in the 100-metre backstroke event in the 11th South Asian Games in Dhaka in 2010. According to his friends, Balakrishhnan was an enthusiastic biker known to take long journeys on the two-wheeler occasionally.

The Anna Nagar traffic investigation wing which is handling the case told TNM that the case is currently registered as an accident. Balakrishnan was riding home in Jayalakshmi Colony, Shenoy Nagar with a female pillion.

""He tried to overtake the lorry and moved correctly but seems to have lost balance somehow. He fell before the lorry while his friend fell the other side. The front wheel of the lorry ran over his stomach. He died on the spot,"" says an officer involved in the case. ""We have recovered the CCTV footage from the spot. It seems to have been a freak accident. It is regrettable,"" he added.

Friends and family mourn loss

The funeral for the 29-year-old was held at 3pm on Wednesday. Friends who have known Balakrishnan from their school days recall that he was a very talented student who shined in anything he took up.

""He was a champion in everything he took interest in. Never let negativity bog him down nor did he ever let people around him get knocked down,"" says Venkat Raman, a close friend of Balakrishnan. ""He was so full of energy, optimism and truly a source of inspiration to everyone he knew,"" he adds.

Sneha Ramesh, another childhood friend of the swimmer says that despite his achievement he was extremely grounded.

""He was the life of any gathering and would always crack everyone up,"" she says. "" He has been swimming from the age of three and has achieved so much but he has never had any airs about himself. He was an avid biker and it is unfortunate that he just came back to India and this happened.""","South Asian Games swimming champion MB Balakrishnan dies in road accident29-year-old MB Balakrishnan, who had won a gold medal in the South Asian Games, had recently returned to India after working in the US.

Road accidents are the leading cause of death among people in the 5-29 age-group worldwide according to a World Health Organisation report.

More than 1.35 million lives are lost each year and 50 million people sustain injuries. Globally, road accidents are the tenth leading cause of death.

India accounts for about 5 lakh road accidents annually, one of the highest in the world, in which about 1.5 lakh people die and another 3 lakh become crippled.

Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways V.K. Singh has said that around 71% of 4.49 lakh road accidents in India in 2019 were due to over speeding.

According to experts, the main causes of road accidents in India are rapid urbanisation, poor safety, lack of enforcement, distracted drivers, influence of drugs or alcohol, speeding and a failure to wear seat-belts or helmets.

There has been a 10% reduction in the number of deaths caused due to accidents in the country since the passage of the amended Motor Vehicles Act, said Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari.

He said the government has pledged to reduce 50% accidents in the next five years, and India is a signatory to this at the World Safety Conference held in Sweden recently.

Among various steps being taken to reduce accidents, the government proposes to open 1,000 driving schools in the country.

In 2020, the government launched a central accident database management system known as the Integrated Road Accident Database that will help in analysing causes of road crashes and in devising safety interventions to reduce such accidents in the country.","A video explainer on India's battle with road accidents in numbersRoad accidents are the leading cause of death among people in the 5-29 age-group worldwide according to a World Health Organisation report.
