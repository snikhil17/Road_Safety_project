Addressing the 'Karmayogis' of Border Road Organisation (BRO) via video conferencing, the Union Defence Minister said, ""Accidents on the roads are a cause of great concern for us today. It is a matter of great surprise that our country has less than 3 per cent of the world's total vehicles, but accidents are close to 11 per cent. Every year around 4.5-5 lakh accidents and 1.5 lakh unfortunate deaths occur in the country. It is not less than a silent pandemic.""

""To get rid of all this, whatever steps the government has taken, such as approving the 'National Road Safety Policy', bringing in the 'Motor Vehicle Act 2020', identifying black spots on national highways...these centres also have their own importance,"" he said. BRO on Friday launched four new software for works management, road infrastructure digitisation, human resource management and recruitment management.

""The four software being launched today will bring efficiency to the work of the organization and will also save their time. Their creation also marks the success of 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' and 'Digital India' campaigns,"" stated Singh. The Union Defence Minister said the start of two 'Centres of Excellence' based on the study of 'Road Safety', and roads, bridges, tunnels, air-fields is a matter of great pride for the country. He said these centres complement each other in their objectives.

""Right from its inception, BRO has been playing a vital role in the progress of the nation by building roads, tunnels and other infrastructure in remote areas. The most important component is connectivity. For connectivity, our BRO personnel have been working tirelessly even in the midst of difficulties like severe winter, heat, rain, snowfall. In the last 5-7 years, BRO has made even more remarkable achievements,"" he said. He emphasised the increase in the budget of BRO by three to four times during the last five to seven years is not a trivial matter. Apart from this, 3,270 sets of special high altitude clothing are approved for our engineers and other personnel.

The Union Defence Minister further mentioned the slogans like ""Sawdhani hati durghatna ghati"" also helps making people aware while on road. Singh further extended his best wishes to woman biker Kanchan for her solo expedition.

""I feel good knowing about Kanchan ji who is going to start solo women motorcycle expedition today. I was told that at an early age she started riding a motorcycle. So far she has covered 21,000 km in 10 years. I wish her all the best for this expedition,"" he said. (ANI)

Mumbai: A shocking revelation: At least 25 teenagers are killed in road accidents every day -- or an average of one each hour -- in India, coming to a whopping total of around 9,400 annually, a non-profit organization (NGO) said here on Friday.

Citing the stunning figures for 2017, the NGO Synergie, said the majority of these accidents involved two-wheelers like scooters, motorcycles or mopeds and largely due to helmetless driving or pillion riding by the youngsters.

The reason is youngsters, mostly teenagers, tend to over speed, indulge in rash driving and drive without helmets.

As per the 2017 data, the total injuries due to helmetless driving were 35,975 and 36,687 deaths for all categories of two-wheeler driving.

The revelations came at a workshop, which included Synergie, Global Road Safety Partnership, hosted by International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, attended by around two dozen school and college principals and others.

Expressing concerns over the large number of juvenile deaths due to helmetless driving, including pillion riding, experts said it was aggravated by the dark world of motorbike stunts and illegal street races.

""Education, awareness, and enforcement is the answer to ensure that kids and adults wear helmets while driving on the roads,"" urged Maharashtra's Joint Transport Commissioner Jitendra Patil.

""If a kid is injured or something worse happens, it affects the entire family... Imagine the scenario in the age of 'nuclear' families with a single child,"" pointed out Synergie's Founder Indrani Maitra, who considers it a psychological issue.

State President of Shikshak Bharti Subhash More said education is the key to address these issues, the importance of using helmets for safe driving from a young age and this must reach to each and every school in the country.

Drawing on his own experiences in such cases, Traffic Police Inspector (Education) S. Paradkar said that ""road accidents involving children are very difficult to handle... the sad scene, the condition of the parents... difficult to describe in words"".

In this regard, he mentioned that the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill has been passed by the union cabinet on June 24, which drastically hikes penalties and fines for traffic violations.

Under the proposed new laws covering various aspects of road safety, helmetless driving would attract a fine of Rs1,000 besides suspension of the offender's driving license for three months.","Majority of the accidents 'involved two-wheelers and largely due to helmetless driving'Mumbai: A shocking revelation: At least 25 teenagers are killed in road accidents every day -- or an average of one each hour -- in India, coming to a whopping total of around 9,400 annually, a non-profit organization (NGO) said here on Friday.

Another 21 people were taken to a hospital, some of them in critical condition, following the crash late Friday, said senior police officer Mohit Aggarwal.

Many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition after the fire swept through the bus, he said.

The accident occurred near Kannauj, a town about 200 kilometres (125 miles) southwest of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state.

Police suspect the truck driver lost control over the vehicle, leading to the collision with the bus. The truck driver escaped, police said.

Highlights In 2015, 400 people were killed in road accidents every day

There are no comprehensive road safety legislation in the country yet

Existing Motor Vehicles Act may be replaced with the proposed bill

Its India's worst kept secret - we have the world's most unsafe roads and the situation seems to be getting worse by the year. Over 400 people were killed in road accidents every day in 2015, government data reveals.Fresh data submitted by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways in the Rajya Sabha this week indicates just how alarming the situation is. 1,46,133 people were killed in road accidents in India in 2015, a 4.6% rise over 2014 when 1,39,671 people were killed.In the past one decade, over 1.3 million people have been killed in road accidents but there is still no comprehensive road safety legislation in the country. According to the 234th report of the Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture which has recently been tabled in Parliament, there are several stumbling blocks for replacing the existing Motor Vehicles Act with a proposed Road Transport and Safety Bill, 2015.According to the report, the Ministry ""wanted to change the entire architecture over road transport and road safety in the whole country, basically, setting up a set of authorities at the Central level and the State level to control all aspects of transport and public transport including driving licences.""However, this has not been possible because ""the main hitch is on sharing of revenues between the Centre and the state"" in implementing the changes which have been proposed. In an effort to still try and push the safety measures through, the government claims it is trying to focus on noncontroversial, achievable goals such as ""an increase in the penalty for drunken driving or increasing the penalty for unauthorized driving, minor driving.""While it is well established that our roads and highways are deadly to travel on, according to the data, the states with the highest number of road accidents in 2015 are Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. These states contribute 29.66% to the total number of accidents recorded nationwide. The same states also recorded the highest number of injuries at 2,75,873 in 2015.","States where the highest number of road accidents took place in 2015 are Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala.

At least 44 people are feared dead after a private bus swerved off a mountain road and plunged into a deep gorge in northern India‘s Himachal Pradesh state, according to a government official.

The rescue operation is ongoing and casualties could increase, according to Rohan Chand Thakur, deputy commissioner of Shimla district, where the accident occurred on Wednesday.

“Our officials, workers and medical teams have rushed to the spot for the rescue work. It’s not possible now to say the details,” Thakur said.

The cause of the accident is not yet known.

The Indian Express daily reported that the bus skidded off the road and fell nearly 250 metres downhill.

Among the casualties are 10 women and three children.

OPINION: Why Indian cars are not driven by safety concerns

Only two people, including the ticket checker, survived the crash, according to Thakur.
